My husband found and gave me your Complete Java Masterclass at Udemy as a gift, and I wholeheartedly dove into it as a lifeline. Following your course has been absolutely enjoyable (still working on it, not yet finished), and has been a great way of keeping on course, dedicated and motivated.&nbsp; Yesterday, three months after starting the course, and honestly to my surprise, I received (and accepted!) a job offer as a full-time developer. I wanted to just drop you a line to say thank you for doing this work, for being such a dedicated teacher, and for putting all this knowledge available out there in such an approachable way. It has, literally, been life-changing. <strong> With gratitude,&nbsp; Laura""</strong></p><p><br>The course is a whopping 100 hours long.&nbsp; <strong>Perhaps you have looked at the size of the course and are feeling a little overwhelmed at the prospect of finding time to complete it.&nbsp; &nbsp;Maybe you are wondering if you need to go through it all?</strong></p><p>Firstly, Laura's story above shows that you do not have to complete the entire course - she was yet to complete the course when she accepted her developer job offer.</p><p>Secondly, the course is designed as a one-stop shop for Java.</p><p>The core java material you need to learn java development is covered in the first seven sections (around 14 hours in total).&nbsp; The&nbsp;Java Basics are covered in those sections. The rest of the course covers intermediate, advanced, and optional material you do not technically need to go through.<br><br>For example section 13 is a whopping 10 hours just by itself and is aimed at those students who want to build desktop applications with graphical user interfaces.&nbsp; JavaFX&nbsp;(which is the technology used in this section) is something that most java developers will rarely or never need to work on.&nbsp; So you could skip that section entirely.&nbsp; But if you are one of the few that need to build user interfaces, then the content is there and ready for you.&nbsp; &nbsp;And there are other sections you can completely avoid if you wish.</p><p>If you want to know absolutely everything about Java, then you can go through the entire course if you wish, but it's not necessary to do so if you are just looking to learn the essential information to get a java developer position.</p><p><strong>What version of Java should you learn?<br><br></strong>Generally speaking, you would want to learn the very latest version of a computer programming language, but <strong>that's not the case</strong> <strong>with Java.</strong></p><p>Oracle, the owner of Java release many versions of Java.&nbsp; Some are released and expire in six months, with no future updates or support. &nbsp;Other versions have long-term support, for many years.</p><p>You can probably see why learning a version of Java that has expired makes no sense, and is likely a waste of time.</p><p>A company using Java technology&nbsp;(big or small) is not going to use a version of Java that has no updates or support.&nbsp; They will stick to stable, well-supported versions of Java that get updates.</p><p>Right now, in December 2022, the version of Java that offers this long-term support&nbsp;(LTS) is Java 17 - It's being fully supported until at least 2029 and likely will be extended from there.</p><p>As such, you want to learn the version of Java that your future employer will use, and that's&nbsp;Java 17.</p><p>The course will also be updated in the future as new LTS versions are announced by Oracle.&nbsp; </p><p><strong>BOTTOM&nbsp;LINE:&nbsp;You will learn the RIGHT VERSION&nbsp;of JAVA in this course!&nbsp; Right meaning the right version to maximize your future Java potential with clients or Employers.</strong></p><p><br><strong>Will this course give me core java skills?</strong></p><p>Yes, it will.&nbsp; Core&nbsp;Java is the fundamental part of the Java JDK (the java development kit) that programmers need to learn to move onto other more advanced technologies.</p><p><strong>Why should you take this course?</strong><br><br>It's been a best-seller since its release on Udemy, you would be joining over 742,000 students who are already enrolled in the course.</p><p>There are well over 174,000 reviews left by students.&nbsp; It's rated as the best course to learn Java for beginners.<br><br><strong>What makes this course a bestseller? </strong></p><p>Like you, thousands of others were frustrated and fed up with fragmented Youtube tutorials or incomplete or outdated courses which assume you already know a bunch of stuff, as well as thick, college-like textbooks able to send even the most caffeine-fuelled coder to sleep. </p><p>Like you, they were tired of low-quality lessons, poorly explained topics, and confusing info presented in the wrong way. That’s why so many find success in this complete Java developer course. It’s designed with simplicity and seamless progression in mind through its content.<br><br>This course assumes <strong>no previous coding experience</strong> and takes you from absolute beginner core concepts, like showing you the free tools you need to download and install, to writing your very first Java program.&nbsp; You will learn the core java skills you need to become employable in around 14 hours, and if you choose to, can take advantage of all the additional content in the course. It's a one-stop shop to learn java. If you want to go beyond the core content you can do so at any time.</p><p><strong>Here’s just some of what you’ll learn</strong></p><p>(It’s okay if you don’t understand all this yet, you will in the course)</p><ul><li><p>All the essential Java keywords, operators, statements, and expressions needed to fully understand exactly what you’re coding and why - making programming easy to grasp and less frustrating</p></li><li><p>You will learn the answers to questions like What is a Java class, What is polymorphism and inheritance and to apply them to your java apps.</p></li><li><p>How to safely download and install all necessary coding tools with less time and no frustrating installations or setups</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Complete chapters on object-oriented programming and many aspects of the Java API (the protocols and tools for building applications) so you can code for all platforms and derestrict your program’s user base (and potential sales)</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>How to develop powerful Java applications using one of the most powerful Integrated Development Environments on the market, IntelliJ IDEA! - Meaning you can code functional programs easier. &nbsp;<strong>IntelliJ</strong> has both a <strong>FREE</strong> and&nbsp;PAID version, and you can use either in this course.</p></li></ul><p>(Don’t worry if you’re used to using Eclipse, NetBeans, or some other IDE. You’re free to use any IDE and still get the most out of this course)</p><ul><li><p>Learn Java to a sufficient level to be a be to transition to core Java technologies like Android development, the Spring framework, Java EE&nbsp;(Enterprise edition) in general as well as and other technologies. In order to progress to these technologies, you need to first learn core Java - the fundamental building blocks.&nbsp; That's what this course will help you to achieve.</p></li></ul><p><strong><em>“AP-what?”</em></strong></p><p>Don't worry if none of that made sense. I go into great detail explaining each and every core concept, programming term, and buzzwords you need to create your own Java programs.</p><p>This truly is Java for complete beginners. </p><p>By the end of this comprehensive course, you’ll master Java programming no matter what level of experience you’re at right now. You’ll understand what you are doing, and why you are doing it. This isn’t a recipe book, you’ll use your own creativity to make unique, intuitive programs. </p><p>Not only do these HD videos show you how to become a programmer in great detail, but this course includes a unique <strong>challenge feature</strong>. Each time a core concept is taught, a video presents a challenge for you to help you understand what you have just learned in a <em>real-world scenario.</em></p><p>You’ll go and complete the challenge on your own, then come back and see the answers which I then explain in detail in a video, allowing you to check your results and identify any areas you need to go back and work on.</p><p>This is a proven way to help you <em>understand</em> Java faster and ensure you reach your goal of becoming a Java Developer in record time. Remember doing those old past exam papers in high school or college? It’s the same concept, and it works. </p><p>As your instructor, I have close to&nbsp; <strong>40 years of experience</strong> as a software developer and teacher and have been using Java since the year 2000. Yes, over 22 years <em>(I’ve taught students younger than that)</em>. Meaning not only can I teach this content with great simplicity, but I can make it fun too!</p><p>It’s no surprise my previous students have amazing results...</p><p><strong>See what your fellow students have to say:</strong></p><p>""This course was a guiding light in my ""Becoming a developer"" path from the first step.

<p>Six years ago, I was sitting in the passenger seat of a car with my friend. </p>

<p>My friend turns to me and says ""It's incredible how much I've gotten done in this year! So much has changed.""</p>

<p>And all I could do is smile. Because for me, almost nothing had changed.</p>

<p>The truth is that we all want to use your time well. But in order to do so, you need to know certain principles you'll never learn in school.</p>

<p>I didn't want to face another year where nothing changed. That's why I went after the answers. And it's also why I made this course.</p>

Learn Ethical Hacking From Scratch,/course/learn-ethical-hacking-from-scratch/,857010,Become an ethical hacker that can hack computer systems like black hat hackers and secure them like security experts.,"<p>Welcome this comprehensive Ethical Hacking course! This course assumes&nbsp;you have <strong>NO&nbsp;prior knowledge</strong> and by the end of it you'll be able to&nbsp;<strong>hack systems like black-hat hackers</strong> and <strong>secure them like security experts!</strong></p><p>This&nbsp;course is&nbsp;highly <strong>practical</strong> but it won't neglect the theory; we'll start with ethical hacking basics, breakdown the different penetration testing fields and install the needed software (on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X), then we'll dive and start hacking straight away. You'll <strong>learn everything by example</strong>, by analysing and exploiting different systems such as networks, servers, clients, websites .....etc. We'll never have any boring dry theoretical lectures.</p><p>The course is divided into a number of sections, each section covers a penetration testing / hacking field, in each of these sections you'll first learn how the target system works, the weaknesses of this system, and how to <strong>practically</strong> exploit theses weaknesses to hack this system.</p><p>By the end of the course you will have a strong foundation in most hacking or penetration testing fields and you'll also learn how to <strong>detect, prevent and secure</strong> systems and yourself from&nbsp;the discussed attacks.&nbsp; </p><p><br></p><p>The course is divided into four main sections:&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>1.&nbsp;Network Hacking</strong><em> -&nbsp;</em>This section will teach you how to test the security of both wired &amp; wireless networks. First, you will learn network basics, how they work, and how devices communicate with each other. Then it will branch into three sub sections:&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Pre-connection<strong> </strong>attacks:<em>&nbsp;</em>in this subsection you'll learn a number of attacks that can be executed without connecting to the target network and without the need to know the network password; you'll learn how to&nbsp;<strong>gather&nbsp;information</strong>&nbsp;about the networks around you, discover connected devices, and control connections (<strong>deny/allow devices from connecting to networks</strong>). </p></li><li><p>Gaining Access: Now that you gathered information about&nbsp;the networks around you, in this subsection you will learn how to <strong>crack</strong> the key and get the password to your target network whether it uses<strong> WEP, WPA </strong>or even<strong> WPA2</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Post Connection attacks: Now that you have the key, you can connect to the target network, in this subsection you will learn a number of<strong>&nbsp;powerful techniques</strong>&nbsp;that allow you to gather comprehensive information about the connected devices, <strong>see anything they do on the internet</strong> (such as login information, <strong>passwords</strong>, visited urls, images, videos ....etc), redirect requests, <strong>inject evil code</strong> in loaded pages and much more! All of these attacks work against both wireless and wired networks. You will also learn how to&nbsp;<strong>create a fake WiFi network,</strong>&nbsp;attract users to connect to it and use all of the above techniques against the connected clients.</p><p><br></p></li></ul><p><strong>2.&nbsp;Gaining Access</strong><em> -&nbsp;</em>In this section you will learn two main approaches to&nbsp;<strong>gain full control or hack&nbsp;computer systems</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>Server Side Attacks<em>: &nbsp;</em>In this subsection you will learn how to&nbsp;<strong>gain full access</strong>&nbsp;to computer systems&nbsp;<strong>without user interaction</strong>. You will learn how to gather useful information about a target computer system such as its&nbsp;operating system,&nbsp;open ports, installed services, then use this information to&nbsp;<strong>discover weaknesses and vulnerabilities</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>exploit</strong>&nbsp;them to gain full control over the target. Finally you will&nbsp;learn how to automatically scan servers for vulnerabilities and generate different types of&nbsp;<strong>reports</strong>&nbsp;with your discoveries.</p></li><li><p>Client Side Attacks<em> -&nbsp;</em>If the target system does not contain any weaknesses then the only way to hack it is by interacting with the users, in this subsection you'll learn how to get the target user to install a backdoor on their system without even realising, this is done by&nbsp;<strong>hijacking software updates</strong> or&nbsp;<strong>backdooring downloads </strong>on the fly. This subsection also teaches you how to use social engineering to hack secure systems, so you'll learn how to gather comprehensive information about system users such as their social accounts, friends, their mails.....etc, you'll learn how to <strong>create trojans</strong> by backdooring normal files (such as an image or a pdf) and use the gathered information to spoof emails so they appear as if they're sent from the target's friend, boss or any email account they're likely to interact with, to social engineer them into running your trojan.</p><p><br></p></li></ul><p><strong>3.&nbsp;Post Exploitation</strong><em> -&nbsp;</em>In this section you will learn how to interact with the systems you compromised so far. You’ll&nbsp;learn how to<strong> access the file system </strong>(read/write/upload/execute),&nbsp;<strong>maintain your access</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>spy</strong>&nbsp;on the target (capture key strikes, turn on the webcam, take screenshots....etc) and even&nbsp;use the target computer as a <strong>pivot </strong>to hack other systems.<br></p><p><strong>4.&nbsp;Website / Web Application Hacking</strong><em> -&nbsp;</em>In this section you will learn&nbsp;<strong>how websites work</strong>, how to&nbsp;<strong>gather information</strong>&nbsp;about a target website (such as website owner, server location, used technologies ....etc) and how to&nbsp;<strong>discover </strong>and<strong> exploit </strong>the following dangerous <strong>vulnerabilities</strong> to hack websites:</p><ul><li><p>File Upload.</p></li><li><p>Code Execution.</p></li><li><p>Local File Inclusion.</p></li><li><p>Remote File Inclusion.</p></li><li><p>SQL Injection.</p></li><li><p>Cross Site Scripting (XSS).</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>At the end of each section you will&nbsp;learn how to&nbsp;<strong>detect, prevent and secure</strong> systems and yourself from&nbsp;the discussed attacks.&nbsp; </p><p> </p><p>All the techniques in this course are&nbsp;<strong>practical</strong> and work against real systems, you'll understand the whole mechanism of each technique first, then you'll learn how to use it to hack the target system. By the end of the course you'll be able to modify these techniques to launch more powerful attacks, and adopt them to suit different situations and different scenarios.</p><p>With this course you'll get <strong>24/7 support</strong>, so if you have any questions you can post them in the Q&amp;A section and we'll respond to you within 15 hours.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><em>Notes: </em></p><ul><li><p><em>This course is created for educational purposes only,&nbsp;all the attacks are launched in my own lab or against systems that I have permission to test.</em></p></li><li><p><em>This course is totally a product of Zaid Sabih &amp; zSecurity and no other organisation&nbsp;is associated with it or a certification exam.

The Data Science Course: Complete Data Science Bootcamp,/course/the-data-science-course-complete-data-science-bootcamp/,1754098,"Complete Data Science Training: Mathematics, Statistics, Python, Advanced Statistics in Python, Machine & Deep Learning","<p><strong>The Problem</strong></p><p>Data scientist is one of the best suited professions to thrive this century. It is digital, programming-oriented, and analytical. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that the demand for data scientists has been surging in the job marketplace.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>However, supply has been very limited. It is difficult to acquire the skills necessary to be hired as a data scientist.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>And how can you do that? &nbsp; </p><p>Universities have been slow at creating specialized data science programs. (not to mention that the ones that exist are very expensive and time consuming)&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Most online courses focus on a specific topic and it is difficult to understand how the skill they teach fit in the complete picture &nbsp; </p><p><strong>The Solution</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Data science is a multidisciplinary field. It encompasses a wide range of topics.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><ul><li><p>Understanding of the data science field and the type of analysis carried out &nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Mathematics &nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Statistics&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Python&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Applying advanced statistical techniques in Python&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Data Visualization &nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Machine Learning &nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Deep Learning &nbsp; </p></li></ul><p>Each of these topics builds on the previous ones. And you risk getting lost along the way if you don’t acquire these skills in the right order. For example, one would struggle in the application of Machine Learning techniques before understanding the underlying Mathematics. Or, it can be overwhelming to study regression analysis in Python before knowing what a regression is.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>So, in an effort to create the most effective, time-efficient, and structured data science training available online, we created The Data Science Course 2023.</em></strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>We believe this is the first training program that solves the biggest challenge to entering the data science field <strong>– having all the necessary resources in one place.</strong> &nbsp; </p><p>Moreover, our focus is to teach topics that flow smoothly and complement each other. The course teaches you everything you need to know to become a data scientist at a fraction of the cost of traditional programs (not to mention the amount of time you will save).&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Skills</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;1.&nbsp;Intro to Data and Data Science</strong></p><p>Big data, business intelligence, business analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence. We know these buzzwords belong to the field of data science but what do they all mean?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why learn it?</strong>
As a candidate data scientist, you must understand the ins and outs of each of these areas and recognise the appropriate approach to solving a problem. This ‘Intro to data and data science’ will give you a comprehensive look at all these buzzwords and where they fit in the realm of data science.
&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>2. Mathematics</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Learning the tools is the first step to doing data science. You must first see the big picture to then examine the parts in detail.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>We take a detailed look specifically at calculus and linear algebra as they are the subfields data science relies on.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why learn it?</strong> &nbsp; </p><p>Calculus and linear algebra are essential for programming in data science. If you want to understand advanced machine learning algorithms, then you need these skills in your arsenal.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>3. Statistics</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>You need to think like a scientist before you can become a scientist. Statistics trains your mind to frame problems as hypotheses and gives you techniques to test these hypotheses, just like a scientist. &nbsp; </p><p><strong>Why learn it?</strong> &nbsp; </p><p>This course doesn’t just give you the tools you need but teaches you how to use them. Statistics trains you to think like a scientist.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>4. Python</strong></p><p>Python is a relatively new programming language and, unlike R, it is a general-purpose programming language. You can do anything with it! Web applications, computer games and data science are among many of its capabilities. That’s why, in a short space of time, it has managed to disrupt many disciplines. Extremely powerful libraries have been developed to enable data manipulation, transformation, and visualisation. Where Python really shines however, is when it deals with machine and deep learning.</p><p><strong>Why learn it?</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>When it comes to developing, implementing, and deploying machine learning models through powerful frameworks such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc, Python is a must have programming language. &nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>5. Tableau</strong></p><p>Data scientists don’t just need to deal with data and solve data driven problems. They also need to convince company executives of the right decisions to make. These executives may not be well versed in data science, so the data scientist must but be able to present and visualise the data’s story in a way they will understand. That’s where Tableau comes in – and we will help you become an expert story teller using the leading visualisation software in business intelligence and data science.</p><p><strong>Why learn it?</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>A data scientist relies on business intelligence tools like Tableau to communicate complex results to non-technical decision makers. &nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>6. Advanced Statistics</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Regressions, clustering, and factor analysis are all disciplines that were invented before machine learning. However, now these statistical methods are all performed through machine learning to provide predictions with unparalleled accuracy. This section will look at these techniques in detail. &nbsp; </p><p><strong>Why learn it?</strong> &nbsp; </p><p>Data science is all about predictive modelling and you can become an expert in these methods through this ‘advance statistics’ section. &nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>7. Machine Learning</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>The final part of the program and what every section has been leading up to is deep learning. Being able to employ machine and deep learning in their work is what often separates a data <em>scientist </em>from a data <em>analyst. </em>This section covers all common machine learning techniques and deep learning methods with TensorFlow. &nbsp; </p><p><strong>Why learn it?</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Machine learning is everywhere. Companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon have been using machines that can learn on their own for years. Now is the time for <em>you</em> to control the machines. &nbsp; </p><p><strong>***What you get***</strong></p><ul><li><p>A $1250 data science training program&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Active Q&amp;A support &nbsp; </p></li><li><p>All the knowledge to get hired as a data scientist &nbsp; </p></li><li><p>A community of data science learners &nbsp; </p></li><li><p>A certificate of completion&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Access to future updates &nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Solve real-life business cases that will get you the job&nbsp; &nbsp; </p></li></ul><p><strong>You will become a data scientist from scratch</strong>

I will wait here...</p><p>...</p><p>Amazing, right? What if you knew exactly how to design and build a website like that, completely from scratch? How amazing would that be?</p><p>Well, I'm here to teach you<strong> HTML, CSS, and web design, all by building the stunning website that you just saw</strong>, step-by-step.</p><p>So, after finishing this course, you will know exactly how to build a beautiful, professional, and ready-to-launch website just like Omnifood, by following a 7-step process. And it will even look great on any computer, tablet, and smartphone.</p><p>But what if you want to build a completely different website? Well, no problem! I designed the course curriculum with exactly this goal: to <strong>enable you to design and build any website that you can think of, not just copy the course project</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>So, in order to become a confident and independent developer, capable of building your own websites in the future, you will learn:</strong></p><ul><li><p>The fundamentals of modern and semantic HTML, CSS, and building layouts in a small separate project, which will prepare you for the main course project (<em>www.omnifood.dev</em>). This includes modern flexbox and CSS Grid!</p></li><li><p>How to design beautiful websites, by learning a web design framework I created just for this course. It consists of easy-to-use guidelines for design aspects like typography, colors, images, spacing, and more (this is like a small standalone course!).</p></li><li><p>How to use well-established website components and layout patterns in order to come up with professional-looking designs</p></li><li><p>How to make any website work on any mobile device, no matter the design and layout (responsive design)</p></li><li><p>How to use the 7 steps of building a professional website in practice: planning, sketching, designing, building, testing, optimizing, and launching</p></li><li><p>How to find and use free design assets such as images, fonts, and icons</p></li><li><p>Important developer skills such as reading documentation, fixing code errors on your own, and using professional web development tools</p></li></ul><p><strong>Does this sound like fun?

No problem, just keep reading...</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>[01] Why should you learn HTML and CSS in the first place?</strong></p><p>Building websites allows you to do <strong>fun and creative work, from anywhere in the world, and it even pays well</strong>. Web development is one of the <strong>most future-proof and highest-paying industries</strong> in the world. And HTML and CSS is the entry point to this world!</p><p>But you already know all this, that's why you want to learn HTML and CSS too. Well, you came to the right place!</p><p>This is the best and most complete course for starting your web development journey that you will find on Udemy. It's an <strong>all-in-one package</strong> that takes you from knowing nothing about HTML and CSS, to building beautiful websites using tools and technologies that professional web developers use every single day.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>[02] Why is this course so unique and popular?</strong></p><p><strong><em>Reason #1: The course is completely project-based</em></strong></p><p>Simple demos are boring, and therefore you're gonna learn everything by <strong>building actual projects</strong>! In the final project (<em>www.omnifood.dev</em>), together we hand-code a beautiful and responsive landing page for a <strong>fictional company</strong> that I made up just for the course.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Reason #2: You will not just learn how to code</em></strong></p><p>Coding is great, but it's not everything! That's why we will go through the entire <strong>7-step process</strong> of building and launching our website project.</p><p>So the huge Omnifood project will teach you <strong>real-world skills to build real-world HTML and CSS websites</strong>: how to plan projects and page layouts, how to implement designs using HTML and CSS techniques, how to write clean and organized code, how to optimize websites for good speed performance, and many more.</p><p>On top of that, this course has a <strong>huge focus on beautiful design</strong>. In fact, this is the only course on the market that focuses on both coding and designing, together.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Reason #3: I'm the right teacher for you</em></strong></p><p>With the right guidance and a well-structured curriculum, building websites can be <strong>quite easy and fun to learn</strong>. With a bunch of random tutorials and YouTube videos? Not so much. And that's where I come in.</p><p>My name is Jonas, I'm an experienced web developer and designer, and one of Udemy's top instructors. I have been teaching this bestselling course since 2015 to over 200,000 developers, always listening to feedback and understanding exactly how students actually learn.</p><p>Using that feedback, I recently rebuilt this course from scratch and <strong>designed the ideal course curriculum</strong> for every type of student. It's a <strong>unique blend</strong> of projects, deep explanations, theory lectures, and challenges. I'm sure you're gonna love it!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>[03] Why is this course so long?</strong></p><p><strong>Reason #1:</strong> I take time to <strong>explain every single concept</strong> that I teach, so that you actually learn, and not just copy code from the screen (<strong>this is a course</strong>, not a tutorial)</p><p><strong>Reason #2:</strong> I go into topics that other HTML and CSS courses shy away from: professional web design, component and layout patterns, some CSS theory, website planning in theory and practice, and developer skills. I believe you need all of this to be successful!</p><p><strong>Reason #3:</strong> There is a lot of repetition, so that you actually <strong>assimilate and practice</strong> what you learn. Practice is the single most important ingredient to learning, and therefore I provide plenty of opportunities for you to sharpen your skills</p><p><br></p><p><strong>[04] Here is what's also included in the package:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Up-to-date HD-quality videos, that are easy to search and reference (great for Udemy Business students)</p></li><li><p>Professional English captions (not the&nbsp;auto-generated ones)</p></li><li><p>Downloadable design assets + starter code and final code for each section</p></li><li><p>Downloadable slides for 20+ theory videos (not boring, I promise!)</p></li><li><p>Access to countless free design and development resources that I curated over many years</p></li><li><p>Free support in the course Q&amp;A</p></li><li><p>10+ coding challenges to practice your new skills (solutions included)</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>[05] This course is for you if...</strong></p><ul><li><p>... you are a complete beginner with no idea of how to build a website.</p></li><li><p>... you already know a bit of HTML and CSS from some tutorials or videos, but struggle to put together a good-looking, complete website.</p></li><li><p>... you are a designer and want to expand your skills into HTML and CSS, because all your designer friends are learning how to code (they are smart!).</p></li></ul><p>Basically, if you are an HTML and CSS master, and build the most beautiful websites in the world, then DON'T take the course. Everyone else: you should take the course, today.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>So, does all of this sound great?

Python for linear algebra (for absolute beginners),/course/test-the-pyla-waters/,3231569,Dip your feet into the amazing world of using Python code to understand vectors and matrices.,"<p>This course provides an introduction to using Python to learn linear algebra. It is designed for people who have no (or little)&nbsp;previous exposure to Python or to linear algebra. </p><p><strong>What is linear algebra?</strong></p><p>Linear algebra is the branch of mathematics that deals with vectors and matrices. A&nbsp;vector is a list of numbers, and a matrix is a spreadsheet of numbers.</p><p>That sounds really simple, but linear algebra is at the heart of nearly all applied mathematics, including statistics, machine learning, AI, deep learning, image processing, telecommunications, video games, computer graphics, biomedical signal processing, and the list goes on and on...</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why use Python to learn linear algebra?</strong></p><p>Many people find math difficult but coding easier. You will be amazed at how much better you can learn math by using Python as a tool. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>What will you learn in this course?</strong></p><p>You will learn the basics of getting started with using Python and with using Python to learn mathematics. You'll see an overview of the major topics in linear algebra, although I&nbsp;do not go into a lot of depth on any particular topic. </p><p>By the end of this course, you will know enough to decide whether you want to learn more about Python and math. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>What do you need to know before enrolling?</strong></p><p>Well, you need to know how to use a computer. But you don't need to know anything about computer programming or linear algebra. The only thing you really *need*&nbsp;for this course is the willingness to dedicate 2-3 hours of your time to learning something new.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What do you have to lose?</strong></p><p>The entire course takes 2-3 hours to complete (2 hours of video content, and about an hour to complete the practice problems). This is a great way to see whether you want to continue studying Python for math and linear algebra. And if you decide that this isn't right for you, then you only spent a few hours on it, rather than investing in tens of hours and money. Really, you have nothing to lose!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Who is your instructor?</strong></p><p>I&nbsp;have been teaching data analysis, scientific programming, statistics, and signal processing for almost 20 years. I have several best-seller courses here on Udemy and my courses have well over 10,000 high-ranked reviews (don't believe me -- check out the reviews on this and my other courses!). I&nbsp;take online teaching seriously (although I&nbsp;let a few jokes slip through now and then...), and I remain actively involved in making sure my courses are high quality and up-to-date.</p>",development,data-science

A Practical Introduction to Cloud Computing,/course/introduction-cloud-computing/,1122334,Cloud Computing made simple with real world practical examples,"<p>The 2nd top hit for 'Cloud Computing' on Google says 'Cloud computing is a general term for the delivery of hosted services over the internet.' Unfortunately, that definition is completely wrong.</p>

<p>This course is designed to clear up the many misunderstandings about Cloud Computing and to give you a crystal clear and easy to understand explanation of exactly what it is, how it works, the different options available, the advantages provided and how much it's going to cost.</p>















<p>And I'm not just going to give you the theory, I'm going to show you practical examples which you can follow along with yourself so you'll understand exactly how Cloud Computing works in the real world.<br></p>















<p>I start off with a review in Module 1 of the traditional deployment models of On Premises and Colo so you can understand how Cloud changes things, then explain how server virtualisation revolutionised data center design and paved the way for Cloud.</p>















<p>Module 2 defines Cloud Computing by listing the Essential Characteristics of Cloud services.</p>















<p>You'll learn about the Cloud Service Models of IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, and XaaS in Module 3. I start with an overview of the different models and then dive deep into the details and options of each. I also give lab demos of how to deploy each type.</p>















<p>The Cloud Deployment Models of Public Cloud, Private Cloud, Hybrid Cloud and Community Cloud are covered in Module 4.</p>















<p>Finally in Module 5 I list out the advantages of Cloud Computing and then break out the spreadsheet to show you how to do a TCO cost comparison when choosing between an On Premise or Cloud deployment for a real world workload.</p>















<p>A verifiable course certificate stating you have completed this training will be provided at the end of the course. This will prove to potential future employers that you have the basic cloud knowledge necessary to be an effective member of their IT team, and the motivation to complete further training and be a real asset to their company.
</p>















<p>As a student in this course, you will get an answer to every question you ask in the Ask Question section. I love interaction with my students- anything you want to know, please ask.</p>

If you are looking for an excellent swift programming course, stop there here because you have found it. You will learn Swift from the very beginning of programming all the way through making your own apps that you can upload to the App store."" - Ian Hopjins</em></p><p><em>""SO GOOD!!! </em><strong><em>Retention rate is incredible</em></strong><em> because Angela does a great job in explaining and teaching every aspect of what we are doing. Most of the other instructors on Udemy put code on the screen and pretend nothing happened. This course is amazing! 5/5""</em> - Muhammad Ibrahim</p><p><em>""Angela is a </em><strong><em>spectacular</em></strong><em> teacher!""</em> - Marco Zanirato</p><p><em>""This course was terrific. Only after taking a few more courses from others that I</em><strong><em> realized how good this course</em></strong><em> was. This course taught me more than I was expecting, it provided great instructions and a lot of hands-on tasks to drill-in the concept."" - Marc</em></p><p><em>""Best use of your money! I was a complete beginner but </em><strong><em>Angela made me a pro</em></strong><em> in weeks.""</em> - Burak Tunçbilek</p><p><em>""IT IS #1!!!!!!!!! Absolutely Amazing. The best iOS course i have ever taken. Angela explains everything the way it needs to be explained, so everything is easily understood. The concept of </em><strong><em>this course is built to make you learn, not just watch</em></strong><em> and repeat. Angela is highly educated and it is very much noticeable during the entire course. Again, it is fantastic. Thank you. Please create more courses!!!!!""</em> - Eduard Khachian</p><p><strong>Are you trying to choose between all the different iOS courses on Udemy? Take a look at what students on my course had to say about this:</strong></p><p><em>I have revamped my expectation for what a</em><strong><em> 5 star course </em></strong><em>should be for Udemy. Angela, you're awesome! I already rated the course as 5 stars early on (at about 20% completion), but after completing roughly 70% of the course, I can say this is my favourite Udemy course as of today. Brilliant course Angela!</em> - Alberto L</p><p><em>""I took a lot of courses on Udemy and elsewhere and non of them were as clear and perfectly paced as this one! Angelas approach is really awesome, </em><strong><em>deep and clear</em></strong><em>."" - Žan Fras</em></p><p><em>""I have taken several iOS courses, so far this course had the </em><strong><em>best explanation </em></strong><em>on swift and xcode documentation.

They show all the ways of using Xcode and other services that took me months to learn willy nilly. </em><strong><em>Wish I had this course a year ago</em></strong><em> but even with a year of Swift experience I still found a lot of great information and helpful tips. Love all the extras the course provides especially the assets(graphics, sound files, etc) for practice projects as I'm always taking too much time to find some assets to play with.

Dion's course was excellent. It was all I needed, and I took his practice tests I also purchased. The only thing I think would help other testers is more sophisticated and harder performance-based questions as I experienced ones today that were pretty tough and required more hands-on experience. Overall, though completely worth the money. (Duran navarro, 5 stars)</p></li><li><p>The course is very informative and good for people that has no knowledge about cybersecurity so far. It teaches us about the harm caused by attacks and how to prevent them. I would suggest everyone to take this course, even if they don't wan the certificate from Comptia.&nbsp; (Mahmoud Choumar, 5 stars)</p></li><li><p>Jason is a great pedagogue. He is thorough and amiable. The course has very minimal errors and you can tell he is very strict with the format of his lessons. I had very few questions during the lectures and only experience one issue throughout the whole experience. I will definitely buy more courses from him. I also bought the voucher from his website to get the retake for only 100 bucks! Good job Dion Training! Keep up the great job! (Victor Cabrales, 5 stars)</p></li><li><p>Passed the exam in December of 2022 using this course - FIRST TRY!! This course gave the back bone of everything I needed to pass the Sec. + exam. When the time came to study up a day or two before the actual exam, I used all the practice quizzes/tests from the CompTIA Sec. + study book. Seems thoughtless or stupid to not use the book for actual studying, but I found I learn slightly better in a class environment and this course/videos allowed me that. Thank you for this course and I look forward to many more in the future! Honestly, I haven't taken an ACTUAL exam in years - many years. If I can do it, you all can too! Good luck and God speed!

And yes, this applies even if you have never programmed before. With the right skills which you will learn in this course, you can become employable and valuable in the eyes of future employers.</p><p>Here’s what a few students have told us about the course after going through it.</p><p>“I had very limited programming experience before I started this course, so I have really learned a lot from the first few sections. It has taken me from essentially zero programming skill to a level where I'm comfortable using Python to analyze data for my lab reports, and I'm not even halfway done the course yet. There are other courses out there which focus on data analysis, but those courses are usually targeted at people who already know how to program which is why I chose this course instead. “ – Christian DiMaria<br> <br>“I have been puttering through your Python course . In that time, though, and without finishing it yet I've been able to automate quite a bit at my work. I work in a school system and unifying data from our various student information systems can be incredibly frustrating, time consuming, and at times challenging. Using your course, I've learned enough to write applications that turn massive text files into dictionaries that get ""stitched"" together like a database and output to properly formatted CSV files and then uploaded via SFTP to various systems for secure processing. Our teachers, students, and the tech department have greatly benefitted from this automation. I just wanted to drop you a note thanking you for helping me learn this skill.” – Keith Medlin<br> <br>“This course was great. Within 3 weeks I was able to write my own database related applications.” – Theo Coenen<br> <br>And there are many more students who love the course – check out all the reviews for yourself.</p><p><strong>Will this course give you core python skills?</strong></p><p>Yes it will.  There are a range of exciting opportunities for Python developers. All of them require a solid understanding of Python, and that’s what you will learn in this course.</p><p><strong>Will the course teach me data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence?</strong></p><p>No, it won’t do that – All of these topics are branches of Python programming.  And all of them require a solid understanding of the Python language.</p><p>Nearly all courses on these topics assume that you understand Python, and without it you will quickly become lost and confused.</p><p>This course will give you that core, solid understanding of the Python programming language.</p><p>By the end of the course you will be ready to apply for Python programming positions as well as move on to specific areas of Python, as listed above. </p><p><strong>Why should you take this course?</strong></p><p>There are a lot of Python courses on Udemy – Your instructors, Tim and Jean-Paul are pretty unique in that between them they have around 70 years of professional programming experience.  That’s more than a lifetime of skills you get to learn Python from.</p><p>You can enrol in the course safe in the knowledge that they are not just teachers, but professional programmers with real commercial programming experience, having worked with big companies like IBM, Mitsubishi, Fujitsu and Saab in the past.</p><p>As such you will not only be learning Python, but you will be learning industry best practices for Python programming that real employers demand.  </p><p>And if that’s not enough take a read of some of the many reviews from happy students – there are around 100,000 students who have left around 19,000 reviews.</p><p>This is one of the most popular courses on Python programming on Udemy.</p><p><strong>Here’s just some of what you’ll learn</strong></p><p>(It’s okay if you don’t understand all this yet, you will in the course)</p><p>·       All the essential Python keywords, operators, statements, and expressions needed to fully understand exactly what you’re coding and why - making programming easy to grasp and less frustrating</p><p>·       You will learn the answers to questions like What is the Python For Loop, what is Python used for, how Python switch the traditional syntax of code, and more.</p><p>·       Complete chapters on object-oriented programming and many other aspects of Python, including tKInter (for building GUI Interfaces) and using databases with Python.</p><p>·       Although this is primarily a Python 3 course, a python developer will need to work with Python 2 projects from time to time – We’ll show the difference in both versions to make sure you understand how things work differently in each version.</p><p>·        How to develop powerful Python applications using one of the most powerful Integrated Development Environments on the market, IntelliJ IDEA! - Meaning you can code functional programs easier.  <strong>IntelliJ</strong> has both a <strong>FREE</strong> and PAID version, and you can use either in this course.  PyCharm will also work just fine.</p><p>(Don’t worry if you want to use another IDE. You’re free to use any IDE and still get the most out of this course).<br> <br><strong>Does the course get updated?</strong></p><p>It’s no secret how technology is advancing at a rapid rate. New, more powerful hardware and software are being released <em>every day</em>, meaning it’s crucial to stay on top with the latest knowledge.<br> <br> A lot of other courses on Udemy get released once, and never get updated.  Learning from an outdated course and/or an outdated version of Python can be counter productive and even worse it could teach you the wrong way to do things.</p><p>For example if you apply some parts of Python 2 to Python 3 code, you will get completely different results.</p><p>We cover differences like this in the course and also continually update the course as well.</p><p><strong><em>What if you have questions?</em></strong></p><p>As if this course wasn’t complete enough, we offer <strong>full support</strong>, answering any questions you have <strong>7 days a week</strong> (whereas many instructors answer just once per week, <em>or not at all</em>). </p><p>This means you’ll never find yourself stuck on one lesson for days on end.

I’ve spent years teaching programming, web development, and databases to my in-person bootcamp students. This course combines the best of my offline courses with the convenience of learning online, in a setting that’s best for you. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Upon completing this course, you’ll be able to interact with and query any SQL database out there. You’ll also be able to generate reports with ease, answer company performance questions using data, and integrate MySQL into complete applications.</p><p><strong>So let’s do this!

Mathematics: Proofs by induction,/course/proofs-by-induction/,4736328,Mathematics from high school to university,"<p>How would you prove that a theorem or a formula is true for *all* natural numbers? Try it for n=0, n=1, n=2, etc? It seems to be a lot of work, or even completely impossible, as there are infinitely many natural numbers!</p><p>Don't worry, there is a solution to this problem. This solution is called ""proof by induction"" and this is the subject of this short (and free) course. <em>The Induction Principle</em> is often compared to the ""domino effect"", which will be illustrated in the course. (This is also the reason for our course image.)</p><p>In this course you will learn how induction proofs work, when to apply them (and when not), and how to conduct them. You will get an illustration of this method on a variety of examples: some formulas, some inequalities, some statements about divisibility of natural numbers. You will also get some information about other courses where you can see some theory, and more advanced proofs based on the same principle.</p><p>Sadly, there is no possibility of asking question in free courses, but you can ask me questions about this subject via the QA function in my other course:&nbsp;""Precalculus 1: Basis notions"", where the topic of proofs by induction is covered, both theoretically (Peano's axioms) and practically, with several examples.</p>",teaching-and-academics,math

Programming 101,/course/programming-101/,956404,"Comprehend basic foundational knowledge of hardware, networking, programming and licensing.","<p>Most people do not know how their device's process binary and work with data, from their washing machine to their smart phone. I found even some programmers don't have the knowledge of such; I'm in fact guilty of this sin!</p><p>I missed out by learning a programming language first rather than trying to understand the computer on the hardware level. As programmers we are controlling the hardware and eventually even if you're programming in Javascript you need to know about memory and how the language works. So understanding binary data, persistent and temporary memory, CPU, SPU, GPU, networking and more is crucial even if you're a web developer this still applies to you.</p><p>This course will be a broad foundation of knowledge giving understanding of certain topics that need to be covered; giving you a solid foundation to grow from. I don't believe in understanding a programming language first is the correct way to go about things. Programming languages have evolved as a tool for us. NOT the computer! So if we understand the computer's hardware we'll understand clearly how our program's are controlling our device's.</p><p>Computers are tools that we created to benefit man kind, however as all tools we need to improve them more and more. However the core principle of computers from the very first computer ever invented hasn't changed. Over time the tool or computer has been refined. However the very core process and simplicity in underlying principles has been the same from the foundation of computing which is, processing ones and noughts. Computers have gone from processing 8 to 64 bits at any one time. This is just the computer being able to process more bits and thus more powerful operations can be done at a single time.</p><p>Don't get me wrong computers are far more advanced, but the concept is all I'm saying is simple enough that even a beginner can learn what most people consider advanced and above their pay grade.</p><p>Likewise understanding networking is of vital importance especially for the web developers of today. More apps are going online so understanding network infrastructure, that has been around for over a decade, is still important today.</p><p>What about programming languages? We invented them as tools to communicate with these raw processing machines. We must understand why we have programming languages and how they work. For example what're compilers or transpilers? How have we taken our form of communication, <strong>human </strong><strong>languages</strong>, and turned it into an effective communication to manipulate the computer, <strong>programming languages? </strong>What about variables, constants, functions, objects and arrays that are in all major programming languages today?<strong> </strong>Also all languages have operators and if you didn't have them in a programming language you wouldn't actually have a programming language at all.</p><p>In this course we'll cover even more, what about programming paradigms. Paradigm just means a model on how to do something. So in this case we can write our program's in a certain way or in a certain paradigm. Very few beginners consider the style with which they program. When creating small scale apps it isn't that difficult, however when creating large scale apps, paradigms become imperative.</p><p>Most programming languages give you the flexibility to mix and match programming paradigms or styles for writing your app's. You have a few major styles to choose from such as assembly, procedural and object oriented. Do note in a single app you can mix these paradigms usually procedural and object oriented to best suite that part of your large scale app. I'll show you the styles of these paradigms and then apply procedural and OOP (object oriented paradigm/programming) to demonstrate how the human mind works with differing paradigms; proving that multiple paradigms are the way forward.</p><p>Finally at the end of learning such a broad range of topics in a clear and concise course; you'll also be learning about the licensing which should be covered especially for new comers. Then learning about software morality such as DRM, software patents and many other aspects of how the government is dealing with your data.</p><p>After all this, if you're still not satisfied you can have your 100% money back guarantee if the course actually cost anything. So this last bit is really the bit that sells it, what have you got to loose?</p>",it-and-software,other-it-and-software

Mathematics: Fun tricks for everybody,/course/fun-tricks/,4739416,Mathematics from high school to university,"<p>Mathematics is often thought of as a tool for engineering or finances, but it is not its only purpose. Mathematics is also a product of the human mind which has an aesthetic function: to satisfy the human need of completeness, to give intellectual satisfaction, and even delight.</p><p>This course shows mathematics as art, not as craft. It can help you fall in love (possibly: again) with mathematics, or at least help you understand the math lovers who always praise the beauty of maths.</p><p>All the problems solved in this course are solved with help of really simple tricks, without using complicated theories. Some of them were presented in my earlier (free) course ""Mathematics: Proofs by induction"". In this earlier course, the formulas were proven by induction, while in the present course they are *derived*, so that you don't need to know the result in advance, which you really needed in case of proofs by induction. In some cases you will also get <em>geometrical interpretations</em> of the obtained results (<em>yes: the three rectangles in the course image</em>).</p><p>Because of the time restriction (max 2 hours of video content) for free courses, some problems are solved in articles added as resources for the course.</p><p>All the problems are on high-school level, but the course can be interesting for anybody who wants to see some recreational mathematics and learn some neat tricks.</p><p>The following types of problems are presented here:</p><p>In Section 1: </p><p>Several formulas for <em>sums</em> of elements in sequences of numbers: some arithmetic progressions (sum of all the natural numbers from 1 to n in Lecture 2, sum of all the odd numbers from 1 to 2n-1 in Lecture 3), a geometric progression (Lecture 8), the sequence of the squares of natural numbers (Lecture 4), two less known sequences (in Lectures 5 and 6); in three cases (Lectures 2, 3, and 8) you get nice geometrical interpretations of the results.

And it can be portable as well.</p><p>C++ can do many things that other languages just can't.</p><p>That's why nearly every major language has a way to interface with code written in C++.</p><p>Since C++ has influenced so many languages, if you know C++ you'll likely see elements from C++ in new languages you learn.</p><p><strong>How can a beginner learn C++?</strong><br><br>Find&nbsp;a good course, taught by an instructor with many years of experience in C++ is critical, as is the need for the instructor to have the necessary skills to be able to teach you the language.</p><p>Frank Mitropolous, the instructor in this course has been using C++ for over 2 decades and has taught students in both university courses and industry training courses. &nbsp;He even worked on a C++ compiler development project while he was in the industry.</p><p>So not&nbsp;only will you be learning C++ from an expert C++ programmer, but you'll also be taught by an instructor who has successfully taught&nbsp;at university level for many years.</p><p>As a result, you can take this course with confidence, knowing that you will learn C++ the right way, and in the shortest possible timeframe.</p><p><strong>Which version of C++ should I learn?</strong></p><p>C++ has had many version releases and updates over the years. &nbsp;It's a sad fact that most C++ courses do not teach Modern C++, but focus on old, obsolete versions of C++.</p><p>Frank teaches you Modern C++ (specifically C++ 14 and C++17). &nbsp;</p><p>Learn C++ the right way, with Modern C++, as taught by Frank in this course.</p><p><strong>What about C++20? Don't I need to learn about that as well?</strong></p><p>This course currently covers C++14 and C++17 but is still valid if you ultimately want to learn C++20.&nbsp; </p><p>C++20 is new and the reality is that C++20 compilers and tools are not yet ready for prime time and the industry is using mainly C++14.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So it's not really of any benefit for you to learn C++20 right now when the industry is not using it.&nbsp;</p><p>It's going to take many, many years for the industry to migrate to C++20 and that means jobs for C++20 are not going to be around for quite some time.<br><br>What is available right now, are tons of jobs for Modern C++ developers, and you will obtain those skills in this course. <br><br>It's our sincere advice to focus on learning Modern C++ and not get too hung up on the latest and greatest versions of C++.<br><br>And even if you really do want to learn C++20,&nbsp; the new features in C++20 are mostly advanced features that require understanding the foundations of Modern C++.<br><br>If you don't learn the basics, you won't master any version of C++.</p><p>Learning the foundations of Modern C++ should be your priority, which you will learn in this course!</p><p><strong>Is C++ difficult to learn?</strong></p><p>With all the power and flexibility of C++ comes complexity.</p><p>There is no question that C++ is one of the most complex programming languages out there.</p><p>But with the right instructor and the right training, you really can&nbsp;get up to speed with C++ quickly,&nbsp;and that's what this course is all about.</p><p><strong>What will I learn in this course?</strong></p><p>The course assumes no previous experience with C++ (or even programming in general), and you will end up with the skills to create your own programs in C++.</p><p>Key topics covered include.</p><p>* Looping with while, do/while for, range-based for statements and recursion<br>* Performing calculations and displaying results<br>* Functions<br>* Pointers<br>* Using existing classes and creating objects<br>* Creating your own classes<br>* Using Basic Standard Template Library classes such as Vector<br>* Constructors and Destructors<br>* Copy and Move semantics including Copy constructors, Move constructors, and copy and move assignment&nbsp;<br>* How to overload operators<br>* Using inheritance and class hierarchies<br>* Using Polymorphic functions and dynamic binding&nbsp;<br>* Using smart pointers<br>* Using stream I/O<br>* An introduction to the C++ STL<br>* An introduction to Exception Handling<br>* And much more.</p><p><br><strong>How is this C++ course different from other courses?<br><br></strong>You will learn Modern C++, for one. &nbsp;<strong>Many, perhaps most other courses on Udemy teach you old, obsolete versions of C++.</strong> &nbsp;If you are going to learn C++, it's imperative that you learn the Modern version to maximize your career opportunities and to ensure your skills are up to date.</p><p>The course format includes theory and concepts which are then reinforced with live code examples. Often the C++ debugger is used to step through code and analyze variables to better understand the behavior of C++. The instructor also uses a pen tablet to write on the screen and provide even more visual explanations.</p><p>You won't find better C++ training anywhere, and you will struggle to find someone with as much industry and training experience as&nbsp;your instructor Frank has.</p><p><strong>What do I get out of learning C++?</strong></p><p>More career options for one! &nbsp;C++ is one of the most popular programming languages used in games development. &nbsp; &nbsp;It's also heavily used in embedded applications. &nbsp;Your investment in time in learning C++ will reward you time and time again with more pay, and more opportunities, and frankly, more fun!</p><p><strong>Are you ready to get started?</strong></p><p>If you are ready to get that first paid programming job or to move up to a more senior programming position, then this course is for you! </p><p>Your new job or consulting opportunity&nbsp;awaits! &nbsp;

You want a course that outlines the best way to become a Web Developer, in simple and well explained terms, so that you fully understand topics instead of watching somebody on your screen and having no clue what is going on.<strong> I have taken the best pieces, tools, and practices that I have found over the years, and condensed everything into this course. 50 hours of videos doesn't mean much if the instructor isn't engaging or focuses on outdated topics.&nbsp;I made sure that everything covered in this course is efficient and focuses on getting you job ready as soon as possible!&nbsp;<br><br></strong></p></li><li><p><strong>We&nbsp;have a thriving online chat community so you really feel like you are part of a classroom and not just watching videos by yourself. </strong>You will have a chance to communicate with fellow students, work on group projects together, and contribute to open source projects. Anytime you have a question, you can ask in many locations and get help right away (including from myself).&nbsp;</p><p><br></p></li><li><p>The course is designed to <strong>give you employable skills so you can get a job</strong>. Here is what one student recently wrote after taking the course and being hired right away: <br><br><em>""I’m a self taught dev, who has been out of work for ~6 months. I had some family things that came up that prevented me from seeking permanent employment, so for awhile I was Postmates/Uber delivery driver.<br>&nbsp; <br>After taking this course, I immediately got catapulted back to where I was before, but better equipped and with the knowledge to take on the next job. I had just finished the React section when I went to a recent interview, and it really helped me excel. As of today, I am officially re-employed back in the field, and it is all thanks to this course.&nbsp;I had a blast creating the final project, and FINALLY got around to learning SQL statements, and getting to use them in a project. I’m really ecstatic that Andrei went with teaching relational databases over something like MongoDB, which can also be fun, but is less practical for use on the job.&nbsp; &nbsp;So thanks Andrei&nbsp;, I really enjoyed the course and will be making sure to share it with others who find it helpful. I’m also looking forward to the new ES10 content that was recently added, and going through the DB stuff again when I go to build a personal project."" - J.C.</em></p></li></ol><p><br></p><p>Think of this course like a Web Developer bootcamp. By the end, you will be comfortable using the below skills and you will be able to put them on your resume:</p><ul><li><p><strong>HTML/HTML5</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>CSS/CSS3</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>SemanticUI</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Responsive Design</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Flexbox</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>CSS&nbsp;Grid</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Bootstrap 5</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>DOM Manipulation</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Javascript (including ES6/ES7/ES8/ES9/ES10/ES2020/ES2021/ES2022)</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Asynchronous JavaScript</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>HTTP/JSON/AJAX</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>React +&nbsp;Redux + React Hooks</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Git + Github</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Command Line</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Node.js</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Express.js</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>NPM</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>RESTful&nbsp;API Design</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>PostgresSQL</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>SQL</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Authentication</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Authorization</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Scalable Infrastructure</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Security</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Production and Deployment</strong></p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>You will be taken through online videos and exercises where you will be able to do the following things by the end:<br></p><ul><li><p>Build real complex applications and websites</p></li><li><p>Build an image recognition app so you can add it to your portfolio</p></li><li><p>Go into a job interview confident that you understand the fundamental building blocks of web development and the developer trends in 2023</p></li><li><p>Be able to go off on your own and grow your skills as a developer, having built a solid foundation</p></li><li><p>Learn how frontend, servers, and databases communicate and how they all fit together in the eco system</p></li><li><p>Build your own startup landing page</p></li><li><p>Go off and work remotely by being a freelance developer that can bid on projects</p><p><br></p></li></ul><p>This course is the accumulation of all of my years working in the industry, learning, and teaching. There is so much information out there, so many opinions, and so many ways of doing things, that unless you have spent the last few years working with these technologies in a company, you will never fully understand. So this course is the answer to that&nbsp;exact&nbsp;problem for you: How to gain experience when you need experience to get hired? I have gone through thousands of coding books, online tutorials and bootcamps. <strong>Throughout the years I have taken notes on what has worked and what hasn't, and I have created this course to narrow down the most efficient way to learn with the most relevant information.&nbsp;</strong> </p><p><br></p><p>I am 100% confident that you won't find a course like this out there. We're not going to be building simple todo applications&nbsp;and cat image sliders. We are going to learn actual&nbsp;practical skills that will put you into the workforce. Some unique sections that you won't find anywhere else are:</p><ul><li><p><strong>React.js + Redux:</strong>&nbsp;You will learn the library that companies like Netflix, Facebook and Instagram use to build fast, scalable applications.&nbsp;This is one of the highest in-demand skill in the industry.</p></li><li><p><strong>A day in the life of a developer:</strong>&nbsp;What will your day to day look like and what tools will you&nbsp;use?&nbsp;I will take you through a sample day at a tech company.</p></li><li><p><strong>How does the internet actually work?&nbsp;What is the history of these technologies?:</strong>&nbsp;You will actually understand the underlying concepts of the internet, and how the technologies we have now, have come to be where they are.</p></li><li><p><strong>How do you&nbsp;actually deploy a real life app so that it is secure, and won't get hacked?:</strong>&nbsp;How does a real life app get out to the public in a safe and secure way?</p></li><li><p><strong>What is Machine Learning and how you can&nbsp;harness its power:</strong>&nbsp;Whether you have heard about it or not, this is something that you will hear more and more in the coming years. Those who understand the high level concepts and can harness its power will have an advantage.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>What does your developer environment on your computer look like?:</strong>&nbsp;We will be setting up our computers with all the tools necessary of a developer so you can use the same setup when you go work in the industry.</p></li></ul><p>Why do we teach the above? Because in this day and age, <strong>just knowing HTML CSS&nbsp;and Javascript is not good enough, and you won't be able to grow in your role and command a higher salary. You will learn these things because these are the things you should know in 2023 so that you are miles ahead of the rest.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Make this&nbsp;the year that you took a risk, you learned&nbsp;highly in demand skills, you had new experiences, and you received new opportunities. I hope you join me in this journey. <br><br><strong>This is the proudest work I have ever done in my life and I am confident that you won't find a course better than this. </strong><br><br>See you inside!</p><p>

<p>This course is designed to cover the end-to-end implementation of the major components of AWS. I also give you base from which you can launch into advanced topics in AWS. You will be learning Storage, Computation, and Databases in the form of S3, EC2, or RDB.</p>





<p>I have made sure that this journey becomes a fun and learning experience for you as the student. I have architectured this course so that you can learn step by step how AWS works and you can do the activities that I do in the course yourself.</p>





<p>There is no risk for you as a student in this course. I have put together a course that is not only worth your money, but also worth your time. I urge you to join me on this journey to learn how to dominate the IT world with the one of the most popular Infrastrcture Services: AWS</p>",it-and-software,network-and-security

Learn Mindfulness Meditation for a Calmer and Clearer mind,/course/mindfulness-stress-reduction/,238788,Practical mindfulness meditation course showing the method how to increase concentration and reduce stress,"<p>Hi, I am Per Norrgren, welcome to my mindfulness course.</p>

<p>  	       I first discovered mindfulness some seven years ago when attending an 8 week mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) course — and it changed my life so much that since then teaching mindfulness is my passion and a major part of my life. </p>

<p>I'd love to share with you the peace and the benefits that living mindfully can bring to your life.</p>

<p>  	     Whilst teaching mindfulness in the traditional group setting, I have received request to provide the course in eLearning format so even if you can not make it to a group course, you can still learn mindfulness. </p>

<p>To this end, I created (what I think is) probably the most comprehensive eLearning course on Mindfulness you will find. I have included all my material from the traditional course and added specific audio teachings that goes well for eLearning.</p><p>NOTE! The videos and text material is optional and there if you would like to know more.  The key is to do the audio tracks.</p><p>  The key is to understand how mindfulness works, what happens in the mind and what to expect, then to experience the change under guidance for your self.  This removes the mystic of the guru, stops you aimlessly wonder and ponder if you do it right and also answers the questions that inevitably pops up.</p>

<p>  	       This course is unique in that it includes forty individual audio tracks (divided into 8 weekly sections) where the teachings are embedded in the meditation experience. I have included a short video for each section to give you an overview of what the session aims to achieve. Start each section by watching the video.  </p>

<p>  	       Each section also has a short handout based on the well-known 8-week Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) programme. These are my own notes, thoughts and experiences collected over the years from books, lectures, international conferences, retreats and training courses. They are there to support you with additional information if you are keen to learn more about how it works.  Note, they are from the actual 8 week MBSR course and therefore contain a weekly home work section etc. </p>

<p>  	       This course is designed to make it easy to learn and to practice at the same time. Becoming mindful can be straightforward but most people find they need external guidance to practice effectively when they first start out. This programme provides everything you need to make your mindfulness journey as effortless as possible. It is  structured as easy-to-follow audio tracks, each being ten minutes long. You have five audio tracks per week and I want you to listen to each track twice on the same day. Once in the morning and once in the afternoon/evening. You can of course listen more often if you would like.  </p>

<p>  	       The full programme is intended to run over eight weeks. This is important. You cannot rush mindfulness. The parts of the brain you are exercising and ""re-wiring"" are very old and science has shown that it takes daily practice to create a permanent change to your automatic reactions. You can repeat weeks if you like and take longer than eight weeks if you need to - the important thing is to keep practicing each day.  </p>

<p>  	       I teach from my own personal experience, sharing what I have learned and how I conquered my inner fear, anxiety, stress and burnout. What you learn on this course is permanent, grounded in real life experience and science, and it is very likely that it will change your life.  </p>

<p>In doing this course, not only does it help my clients to deal with the stress in this moment, they are also maximising their chances of maintaining good mental health throughout their lives.<br></p>

<p>Wishing you a wonderful course</p>

<p>in peace</p>

Remember, the average salary of a SQL developer is $103,400! That’s a lucrative career.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p><strong>How come?&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></p><p>Well, when you can work with SQL, it means you don’t have to rely on others sending you data and executing queries for you. You can do that on your own. This allows you to be independent and dig deeper into the data to obtain the answers to questions that might improve the way your company does its business. For instance, Database management is the foundation for data analysis and intelligent decision making.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p><strong>Worried that you have no previous experience?</strong>&nbsp; </p><p>Not an issue.

Our mission is to help you bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge taught at school and in universities and the practical application required at the workplace.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p><strong>So, why do you need to enroll in this course and learn SQL?</strong>

&nbsp; </p><ol><li><p><strong>Salary/Income.</strong> As we pointed out earlier, learning SQL is a great opportunity. There is a significant surge in demand for skills revolving around database management, database administration, and business analysis relying on data. Companies will pay top dollars for specialists who have such know-how

&nbsp; </p></li><li><p><strong>Profession of the future.</strong> In the years to come, data will only grow in importance and size. Therefore, it is great to pick up a skill that will likely increase in demand over the years to come

&nbsp; </p></li><li><p><strong>Analytical reasoning.</strong> Programming languages are a great way to train your mind. Furthermore, understanding a business task and looking for its solution through writing code can be really interesting and stimulating once you become familiar with the basics &nbsp; </p></li></ol><p><strong>What about certificates? Do you provide a certificate?</strong></p><p>Upon completion of the course, you will be able to download a certificate of completion with your name on it.

Mathematics: Completing the square,/course/completing-the-square/,4531610,Mathematics from high school to university,"<p><strong>Mathematics: Completing the square</strong></p><p><em>Mathematics from high school to university</em></p><p><br></p><p>1. Completing the square: how the method works, and why</p><p>You will learn about the method of completing the square, how it works and why. This remarkable (and elementary!) method has surprisingly many applications in advanced mathematics, and this is why it is really good to master it. Geometrical illustrations will give you a nice visual explanation of both the method and the name of the method.</p><p><br></p><p>2. A glimpse into some applications of completing the square</p><p>You will learn about various applications of completing the square, starting with quite elementary applications (high-school level) such as solving quadratic equations and drawing graphs of second degree polynomials, and continuing with some information about more advanced applications such as identifying quadratic curves and surfaces, determining definiteness of square matrices (or corresponding quadratic forms), and optimization of functions in two or more variables. These applications will <em>not</em> be treated in this course due to time constraints, but you will get information in which courses you find both theory and practice on the topics. You will also get some practice in completing the square. In this brief course I have chosen to inform you about applications of completing the square in Algebra, Calculus, and Linear Algebra and Geometry.</p><p><strong>A note</strong>: Another typical application of completing the square (<strong><em>not</em></strong> discussed in this course) is in Calculus 2, when you must integrate a rational function (a function of the type p(x)/q(x), where both p(x) and q(x) are polynomials). After performing partial fraction decomposition, you will represent your function as a sum of simpler fractions, with denominators being first-degree polynomials or second-degree polynomials without real zeros. This second type, when integrated, will lead to some function defined by arctan; in order to perform this integration in a correct way (variable substitution), you must... complete the square! You can learn about partial fraction decomposition in my course ""Precalculus 2: Polynomials and rational functions"", and about the integration method mentioned above in my upcoming course ""Calculus 2, part 1 of 2: Integrals with applications"".</p><p><br></p><p>3.

<p><br></p>



<p><strong>90% of the population doesn't know how to breathe.</strong></p>



<p>Studies show that most people are actually holding in negative emotions, tension, and nervous system trauma - and this results in what is called ""Shallow Breathing"".

"Deep Learning A-Z™ 2023: Neural Networks, AI & ChatGPT Bonus",/course/deeplearning/,1151632,Learn to create Deep Learning Algorithms in Python from two Machine Learning & Data Science experts. Templates included.,"<p>*** As seen on Kickstarter ***</p><p>Artificial intelligence is growing exponentially. There is no doubt about that. Self-driving cars are clocking up millions of miles, IBM Watson is diagnosing patients better than armies of doctors and Google Deepmind's AlphaGo beat the World champion at Go - a game where intuition plays a key role.

  </p>

<p>But the further AI advances, the more complex become the problems it needs to solve. And only Deep Learning can solve such complex problems and that's why it's at the heart of Artificial intelligence.

  </p>



<p><strong>--- Why Deep Learning A-Z? ---</strong>

  </p>



<p>Here are five reasons we think Deep Learning A-Z™ really is different, and stands out from the crowd of other training programs out there:

  </p>



<p><strong>1. ROBUST STRUCTURE </strong>

  </p>



<p>The first and most important thing we focused on is giving the course a robust structure. Deep Learning is very broad and complex and to navigate this maze you need a clear and global vision of it. 

  </p>



<p>That's why we grouped the tutorials into two volumes, representing the two fundamental branches of Deep Learning: Supervised Deep Learning and Unsupervised Deep Learning. With each volume focusing on three distinct algorithms, we found that this is the best structure for mastering Deep Learning.

  </p>



<p><strong>2. INTUITION TUTORIALS</strong>

  </p>



<p>So many courses and books just bombard you with the theory, and math, and coding... But they forget to explain, perhaps, the most important part: <strong>why you are doing what you are doing. </strong>And that's how this course is so different. We focus on developing an intuitive <em>*feel*</em> for the concepts behind Deep Learning algorithms.

  </p>



<p>With our intuition tutorials you will be confident that you understand all the techniques on an instinctive level. And once you proceed to the hands-on coding exercises you will see for yourself how much more meaningful your experience will be. This is a game-changer.

  </p>



<p><strong>3. EXCITING PROJECTS</strong>

  </p>



<p>Are you tired of courses based on over-used, outdated data sets?

  </p>



<p>Yes? Well then you're in for a treat.

  </p>



<p>Inside this class we will work on Real-World datasets, to solve Real-World business problems. (Definitely not the boring iris or digit classification datasets that we see in every course). In this course we will solve six real-world challenges:

  </p>



<ul><li>Artificial Neural Networks to solve a Customer Churn problem

  </li><li>Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Recognition

  </li><li>Recurrent Neural Networks to predict Stock Prices

  </li><li>Self-Organizing Maps to investigate Fraud

  </li><li>Boltzmann Machines to create a Recomender System

  </li><li>Stacked Autoencoders* to take on the challenge for the <strong>Netflix $1 Million prize</strong>

  </li></ul>



<p><em>*Stacked Autoencoders is a brand new technique in Deep Learning which didn't even exist a couple of years ago. We haven't seen this method explained anywhere else in sufficient depth.</em>

  </p>



<p><strong>4. HANDS-ON CODING </strong>

  </p>



<p>In Deep Learning A-Z™ we code together with you. Every practical tutorial starts with a blank page and we write up the code from scratch. This way you can follow along and understand exactly how the code comes together and what each line means. 

  </p>



<p>In addition, we will purposefully structure the code in such a way so that you can download it and apply it in your own projects. Moreover, we explain step-by-step where and how to modify the code to insert YOUR dataset, to tailor the algorithm to your needs, to get the output that you are after. 

  </p>



<p>This is a course which naturally extends into your career.

  </p>



<p><strong>5. IN-COURSE SUPPORT</strong>

  </p>



<p>Have you ever taken a course or read a book where you have questions but cannot reach the author? 

  </p>



<p>Well, this course is different. We are fully committed to making this the most disruptive and powerful Deep Learning course on the planet. With that comes a responsibility to constantly be there when you need our help.

  </p>



<p>In fact, since we physically also need to eat and sleep we have put together a team of professional Data Scientists to help us out. Whenever you ask a question you will get a response from us within 48 hours maximum. 

  </p>



<p>No matter how complex your query, we will be there. The bottom line is we want you to succeed. 

  </p>



<p><strong>--- The Tools ---</strong>

  </p>



<p>Tensorflow and Pytorch are the two most popular open-source libraries for Deep Learning. In this course you will learn both!

  </p>



<p>TensorFlow was developed by Google and is used in their speech recognition system, in the new google photos product, gmail, google search and much more. Companies using Tensorflow include AirBnb, Airbus, Ebay, Intel, Uber and dozens more. 

  </p>



<p>PyTorch is as just as powerful and is being developed by researchers at Nvidia and leading universities: Stanford, Oxford, ParisTech. Companies using PyTorch include Twitter, Saleforce and Facebook.

  </p>



<p>So which is better and for what? 

  </p>



<p>Well, in this course you will have an opportunity to work with both and understand when Tensorflow is better and when PyTorch is the way to go. Throughout the tutorials we compare the two and give you tips and ideas on which could work best in certain circumstances.

  </p>



<p>The interesting thing is that both these libraries are barely over 1 year old. That's what we mean when we say that in this course we teach you the most cutting edge Deep Learning models and techniques.

  </p>



<p><strong>--- More Tools ---</strong>

  </p>



<p><em>Theano </em>is another open source deep learning library. It's very similar to Tensorflow in its functionality, but nevertheless we will still cover it.

  </p>



<p><em>Keras </em>is an incredible library to implement Deep Learning models. It acts as a wrapper for Theano and Tensorflow. Thanks to Keras we can create powerful and complex Deep Learning models with only a few lines of code. This is what will allow you to have a global vision of what you are creating. Everything you make will look so clear and structured thanks to this library, that you will really get the intuition and understanding of what you are doing.

  </p>



<p><strong>--- Even More Tools ---</strong>

  </p>



<p><em>Scikit-learn </em>the most practical Machine Learning library. We will mainly use it:  

  </p>



<ul><li>to evaluate the performance of our models with the most relevant technique, k-Fold Cross Validation

  </li><li>to improve our models with effective Parameter Tuning

  </li><li>to preprocess our data, so that our models can learn in the best conditions

  </li></ul>



<p>And of course, we have to mention the usual suspects. This whole course is based on Python and in every single section you will be getting hours and hours of invaluable hands-on practical coding experience. 

  </p>



<p>Plus, throughout the course we will be using Numpy to do high computations and manipulate high dimensional arrays, Matplotlib to plot insightful charts and Pandas to import and manipulate datasets the most efficiently.

  </p>



<p><strong>--- Who Is This Course For? ---</strong>

  </p>



<p>As you can see, there are lots of different tools in the space of Deep Learning and in this course we make sure to show you the most important and most progressive ones so that when you're done with Deep Learning A-Z™ your skills are on the cutting edge of today's technology.

  </p>



<p><strong>If you are just starting out into Deep Learning, </strong>then you will find this course extremely useful. Deep Learning A-Z™ is structured around special coding blueprint approaches meaning that you won't get bogged down in unnecessary programming or mathematical complexities and instead you will be applying Deep Learning techniques from very early on in the course. You will build your knowledge from the ground up and you will see how with every tutorial you are getting more and more confident.

  </p>



<p><strong>If you already have experience with Deep Learning, </strong>you will find this course refreshing, inspiring and very practical. Inside Deep Learning A-Z™ you will master some of the most cutting-edge Deep Learning algorithms and techniques (some of which didn't even exist a year ago) and through this course you will gain an immense amount of valuable hands-on experience with real-world business challenges. Plus, inside you will find inspiration to explore new Deep Learning skills and applications.

  </p>



<p><strong>--- Real-World Case Studies ---</strong>

  </p>



<p>Mastering Deep Learning is not just about knowing the intuition and tools, it's also about being able to apply these models to real-world scenarios and derive actual measurable results for the business or project. That's why in this course we are introducing six exciting challenges:

  </p>



<p><strong>#1 Churn Modelling Problem</strong>

  </p>



<p>In this part you will be solving a data analytics challenge for a bank. You will be given a dataset with a large sample of the bank's customers. To make this dataset, the bank gathered information such as customer id, credit score, gender, age, tenure, balance, if the customer is active, has a credit card, etc. During a period of 6 months, the bank observed if these customers left or stayed in the bank. 

  </p>



<p>Your goal is to make an Artificial Neural Network that can predict, based on geo-demographical and transactional information given above, if any individual customer will leave the bank or stay (customer churn). Besides, you are asked to rank all the customers of the bank, based on their probability of leaving. To do that, you will need to use the right Deep Learning model, one that is based on a probabilistic approach. 

  </p>



<p>If you succeed in this project, you will create significant added value to the bank. By applying your Deep Learning model the bank may significantly reduce customer churn.

  </p>



<p><strong>#2 Image Recognition</strong>

  </p>



<p>In this part, you will create a Convolutional Neural Network that is able to detect various objects in images. We will implement this Deep Learning model to recognize a cat or a dog in a set of pictures. However, this model can be reused to detect anything else and we will show you how to do it - by simply changing the pictures in the input folder. 

  </p>



<p>For example, you will be able to train the same model on a set of brain images, to detect if they contain a tumor or not. But if you want to keep it fitted to cats and dogs, then you will literally be able to a take a picture of your cat or your dog, and your model will predict which pet you have. We even tested it out on Hadelin’s dog!

  </p>



<p><strong>#3 Stock Price Prediction</strong>

  </p>



<p>In this part, you will create one of the most powerful Deep Learning models. We will even go as far as saying that you will create the Deep Learning model closest to <em>“Artificial Intelligence”</em>. Why is that? Because this model will have long-term memory, just like us, humans. 

  </p>



<p>The branch of Deep Learning which facilitates this is Recurrent Neural Networks. Classic RNNs have short memory, and were neither popular nor powerful for this exact reason. But a recent major improvement in Recurrent Neural Networks gave rise to the popularity of LSTMs (Long Short Term Memory RNNs) which has completely changed the playing field. We are extremely excited to include these cutting-edge deep learning methods in our course! 

  </p>



<p>In this part you will learn how to implement this ultra-powerful model, and we will take the challenge to use it to predict the real Google stock price. A similar challenge has already been faced by researchers at Stanford University and we will aim to do at least as good as them. 

  </p>



<p><strong> #4 Fraud Detection</strong>

  </p>



<p>According to a recent report published by Markets &amp; Markets the Fraud Detection and Prevention Market is going to be worth $33.19 Billion USD by 2021. This is a huge industry and the demand for advanced Deep Learning skills is only going to grow. That’s why we have included this case study in the course.  

  </p>



<p>This is the first part of Volume 2 - Unsupervised Deep Learning Models. The business challenge here is about detecting fraud in credit card applications. You will be creating a Deep Learning model for a bank and you are given a dataset that contains information on customers applying for an advanced credit card. 

  </p>



<p>This is the data that customers provided when filling the application form. Your task is to detect potential fraud within these applications. That means that by the end of the challenge, you will literally come up with an explicit list of customers who potentially cheated on their applications.

  </p>



<p><strong>#5 &amp; 6 Recommender Systems</strong>

  </p>



<p>From Amazon product suggestions to Netflix movie recommendations - good recommender systems are very valuable in today's World. And specialists who can create them are some of the top-paid Data Scientists on the planet.

  </p>



<p>We will work on a dataset that has exactly the same features as the Netflix dataset: plenty of movies, thousands of users, who have rated the movies they watched. The ratings go from 1 to 5, exactly like in the Netflix dataset, which makes the Recommender System more complex to build than if the ratings were simply “Liked” or “Not Liked”. 

  </p>



<p>Your final Recommender System will be able to predict the ratings of the movies the customers didn’t watch. Accordingly, by ranking the predictions from 5 down to 1, your Deep Learning model will be able to recommend which movies each user should watch. Creating such a powerful Recommender System is quite a challenge so we will give ourselves two shots. Meaning we will build it with two different Deep Learning models.

  </p>



<p>Our first model will be Deep Belief Networks, complex Boltzmann Machines that will be covered in Part 5. Then our second model will be with the powerful AutoEncoders, my personal favorites. You will appreciate the contrast between their simplicity, and what they are capable of.

  </p>



<p>And you will even be able to apply it to yourself or your friends. The list of movies will be explicit so you will simply need to rate the movies you already watched, input your ratings in the dataset, execute your model and voila! The Recommender System will tell you exactly which movies you would love one night you if are out of ideas of what to watch on Netflix!  

  </p>



<p><strong>--- Summary ---</strong>

  </p>



<p>In conclusion, this is an exciting training program filled with intuition tutorials, practical exercises and real-World case studies. 

  </p>



<p>We are super enthusiastic about Deep Learning and hope to see you inside the class!

Digital Body Language,/course/digital-body-language/,910996,"You will learn what your digital brand says about you through your social media pictures, website and more.","<p>Do you have a digital brand?</p>

<p>If you have ever posted anything online then the answer is YES!</p>







<ul><li>Whether you have a booming personal website or a simple LinkedIn page…</li><li>Whether you write your own blog or have a basic online dating profile…</li><li>Whether you like it or not…</li></ul>







<p>…you have a digital brand.</p>





<p>I want to show you how to optimize it. I did not realize the importance of online personal brands until a few things happened all at once. Let me share three stories so you can understand why digital brands are so important:</p>





<p>Story #1:</p>





<p>Last spring I met a guy named Dave at a friend’s party. My friend introduced us and said something like, “Dave, meet Vanessa. Vanessa, meet Dave. He is single and looking for a great girl. He is amazing and you have to hook him up with someone you know!” I have a personal passion for matchmaking, so I was very excited to meet Dave and set him up. After a few minutes, I was convinced that there was some giant misunderstanding. This guy was GREAT–how could he be single?! He said he had been online dating to meet people and just couldn’t get any dates. I asked him to pull up his profile so I could take a look and…wow. His profile was super sleazy–totally opposite of the guy standing in front of me! The pictures were misleading, his little intro video came across as super inauthentic and I immediately knew why he wasn’t getting dates. <strong>He had a lot to offer, but had an easy-to-fix Digital Branding Problem.</strong></p>







<p>Story #2:</p>





<p>Here at the Science of People, we often help entrepreneurs with their pitches–especially if they are trying to raise venture capital money or speaking at conferences. One female entrepreneur in particular was trying to raise money for a Kickstarter campaign. She had a great product that could help a lot of people. She had begun taking sales on her website and launched a Kickstarter campaign last April. The problem: No one was buying. She contacted us to look at her website, video and Kickstarter page. Before looking at her online assets I got to read about her amazing product in an email. When I finally clicked over to her website and campaign, I was shocked. Although her idea was great, her website, sales page and Kickstarter video left A LOT to be desired. No wonder she wasn’t getting sales. She had a great business but a <strong>huge Digital Branding Problem.</strong></p>







<p>Story #3:</p>





<p>A few weeks later, I attended a tech conference, and I heard a BRILLIANT programmer speak on a panel. During his short 30 minute panel he absolutely stole the stage from the other particpants. He shared some of the tools and web applications he has developed and blew everyone in the audience away. During Q&amp;A everyone was directing questions towards him and afterwards he had a line of 10 people dying to talk to him. I happened to be sitting next to a Vice President of a major sports brand in the audience. She turned to me at one point and said, “I would do anything to get this guy on our tech team. I wonder if he would consider switching jobs?” I suggested she try Google searching him to see if she could get his email. A few minutes later she turned her laptop towards me with a horrified look. She pointed at his personal website and said, “I can’t believe this is the same guy! He clearly does brilliant work for his companies, but hasn’t applied any of it to his own stuff.” His personal website was barren, sterile and disorganized. <em>Very</em> unlike the person we were seeing on stage. The VP told me that his website was a deal breaker, saying something like, “We want people who are above average in all areas of their brand. His brand rubs off on us too.” <strong>He had a misleading Digital Branding Problem.</strong></p>







<p>What do these stories tell us? There are myths about digital branding:</p>







<ul><li><strong>Myth:</strong> If I don’t own a business, I don’t need to worry about my personal brand.</li><li><strong>Myth:</strong> A Facebook page doesn’t count as a digital brand.</li><li><strong>Myth:</strong> My business model speaks for itself. I don’t need to worry about online positioning.</li><li><strong>Myth:</strong> What I say on my profile or website is more important than the visual cues.</li></ul>







<p>Let’s Stop the Madness!</p>





<p>It drives me crazy when talented, wonderful, awesome people forget about their online assets.</p>







<p><strong>A bad digital first impression can destroy your chances at a job, on a date or in a relationship.</strong></p>







<p>You have 0.05 seconds to make a good first impression online. In those 50 milliseconds you have to hook someone and convey who you are, why they should connect with you AND build trust. You may realize it, but in the digital age, often times your first impression happens even before you meet someone. The problem is, you often focus on the verbal content of your profiles and websites. But since your digital first impression happens so quickly–before someone reads any of your content or descriptions, you have to capture their attention with nonverbal cues or your digital body language.</p>







<p>If you have no idea what your digital first impression is, let alone how to fix it…</p>

More people need to hear this before age 20!!!""</em></p><p><em>""I love the honesty and how the presenter doesn't beat around the bush.""</em></p><p><em>""I really enjoyed Wolfgang Riebe's course. He has great insights, and is very honest about himself and passionate about what he shares, and down-to-earth as well as funny at times. He really cares, and it makes viewers able to relate to him. I recommend the course to anybody who wants to get a better outlook on life and see things a little more positively.""</em></p><p><em>""Yes Wolfgang was true and right on how he commented about how the world is. I liked how Wolfgang also admits that somethings can frustrate him, in which he was honest. Even the quotations were right and had meaning to them. I did enjoy this course and it was my first time I discovered this man Wolfgang Riebe.""</em></p><p><em>""Once the videos started, I did not think I would bond with them, but actually some of the tips are pretty good and are common sense really.

It is a straight forward, no holds barred, authentic and down to earth. Hence I get it that not everyone will agree with my points of view.</em></p><p><em>A speaker colleague of mine once said that if 51% of people like you, you are on a winning streak. Of all the reviews - over 95% have enjoyed the course and appreciated my frankness. It's not a course for everyone! Why? I believe that with all the political correctness, greed and entitlement today, we need more people to be openly frank and call a 'spade a spade'. Sadly, not everyone likes hearing this! Remember, this is a free course no one is forcing you to watch it! All I'm doing is trying to leave a legacy and make the world a better place. I trust that those of you who decide to watch this course see and realise that I am speaking honestly from the heart and my only desire is to try and help you find meaning within this crazy world we live it.</em></p>",personal-development,personal-transformation

JavaScript Fundamentals,/course/javascriptfundamentals/,548068,Learn JavaScript hands on in quick and easy steps,"<p>This hands on JavaScript training course provides the fundamental knowledge necessary to design and develop dynamic Web pages using JavaScript. It introduces students to client-side JavaScript and how the language can be used to turn static HTML pages into dynamic, interactive Web pages. </p><p>JavaScript is the globally used client-side scripting language for the web. Most browsers support the language by default, so you can get started using JavaScript and HTML with a simple text editor and browser for testing. Client-side, programming languages make web pages dynamic without making calls to your web servers for every button clicked, character typed, or mouse moved. The JavaScript language is so popular that thousands of developers have made customised libraries that make development even easier for other programmers and web designers. If you design web pages, you'll certainly need to know JavaScript to make a custom UI (user interface).</p><p>JavaScript topics include adding JavaScript to a Webpage, use of dialogs to interact with the user and JavaScript intrinsic objects such as Date, Array and Math.

Learn to Program in Javascript: Beginner to Pro,/course/programming-in-javascript/,217000,"Don't just be a good programmer, become a great one, because that is what matters.","<p>  	Javascript is the language of the web. So if you want to become a web developer, Javascript is a must learn language. This is an in-depth course which teaches seemingly difficult concepts like functional programming in a easy to understand way. Along the course, we also compare Javascript with other languages like Java, so that people having some experience with a language like C, Java or C#, which are statically typed languages, can easily understand how to write good Javascript programs.   </p>

<p>  	Javascript has been notorious when it comes to finding bugs in the program. This course also talks about some pitfalls in the language which should be avoided, so that you have a much easier time writing code and debugging in this language.  </p>",development,programming-languages

14-day English language fluency course,/course/14-day-english-language-fluency-course/,1506978,You will improve your spoken English in just 2 weeks!,"<p><strong>Are you struggling to speak English?</strong>

  </p>













<p>Have you spent hours learning new words, studying grammar, watching English movies, listening to English music and now you wonder why you can’t use all of this knowledge in a conversation?

  </p>





























<p>Well, here’s your answer!

  </p>





























<p>Speaking English is a skill- just like swimming. Can you learn swimming from a book? No. How about from a movie? No, again. You need to get into the pool and start doing the action. Speaking, like swimming, is an action. 

  </p>





























<p>So, the ONLY way to improve your spoken English is to speak.

  </p>





























<p>That’s where this course helps you!

  </p><p><br></p>



























<p><strong>How does this course work?</strong>

  </p>





























<p>I have divided this course into 14 days. Each day has a new topic and each topic is divided into <strong>4 short videos</strong>.

  </p>





























<p>The <strong>first video </strong>will introduce 8 words or terms. In this video I will explain the meaning of these words and provide an example of how it can be used in a sentence. At the end, we will review the vocabulary.

  </p>





























<p>In the <strong>second video</strong> I provide an example speech of the topic. In this video I use the words from video 1 to make a speech. This allows you to see me using the vocabulary.

  </p>





























<p>The <strong>third</strong> video is the most important video. In this video I give you a chance to make a speech using the vocabulary of the topic. But there is one rule:

  </p>





























<ul><li>You can’t say: umm, ahh, enn or any other vocal-filled pause or interjection.

  </li></ul>



























<p><em>Why?</em>

  </p>





















<p>Well, this is a fluency course. If you always need to stop and think about what to say next, then you’re not speaking fluently. If you do break the rule, simply stop and start your speech again. 

  </p>





























<p>The <strong>final video</strong> is a dictation test. Listen to me say the words from the topic and write them down. Then, compare your spelling with the actual spelling of the words.

  </p><p><br></p>



























<p><strong>Can I really improve my spoken English with this course?</strong>

  </p>





















<p>I believe you can. I have used this method with literally hundreds of students and have seen my students’ speaking ability improve dramatically. 

  </p><p><br></p>



























<p><strong>Why should I choose this course over other courses?</strong>

  </p>





























<p><em><strong>Price.</strong></em>

  </p>





















<p>Firstly, it’s free (for the moment) so you have nothing to lose.

  </p>





























<p><em><strong>Enthusiastic teacher.</strong></em>

  </p>





















<p>Secondly, I think I teach this course in an enthusiastic way and hope that this enthusiasm spreads to you. I believe that if you want to learn anything, you must be enthusiastic or you will simply give up. 

  </p>





























<p><em><strong>There is a finish line that you can see.</strong></em>

  </p>





















<p>By knowing that this course is only 14 days, I hope that it provides you with the feeling that it is short sprint and not a marathon.  

  </p>





























<p><em><strong>Consistency is key (or king).</strong></em>

  </p>





















<p>It’s much more effective to study a few minutes a day than to study for a few hours once or twice a week. I want English to be your hobby that you enjoy not your habit that you hate. By only studying for a few minutes a day (but doing it every day) it is less likely that you will come to hate learning. 

  </p>





























<p><em><strong>Remember what you learn.</strong></em>

  </p>





















<p>I believe that quality is more important than quantity. My rule as an ESL/EFL teacher is to teach between 5 to 10 words per 1-hour class. This is because how many words you study is not important. Only how many words you can use is the number that we should care about. I see many students trying to remember 30 or even 50 words a day! But, the sad thing is the next day they may only remember 4 or 5. I will teach you vocabulary in a way that allows you to retain the vocabulary that you learn. 

  </p>





























<p><em><strong>Develop a habit for learning.</strong></em>

  </p>





















<p>Finally, many people say that it takes 2 weeks to develop a habit. I hope this course will provide you with the framework to develop a habit of study. While this is my only course (at the moment) here on Udemy, there are many other fantastic courses on here to study. I hope that you can use this course as a stepping stone for your continued growth.

  </p><p>

















</p>

















<p><strong>Sign up now and start speaking right away!</strong>

  

</p>



























<p>So, if you want to learn to speak English more fluently whilst getting your hands on some useful vocabulary, then why not try my 14-day English language fluency course? You have nothing to lose and you will be very glad you did.

  </p>

Statistics for Data Science and Business Analysis,/course/statistics-for-data-science-and-business-analysis/,1298780,"Statistics you need in the office: Descriptive & Inferential statistics, Hypothesis testing, Regression analysis","<p><strong>Do you want to work as a Marketing Analyst, a Business Intelligence Analyst, a Data Analyst, or a Data Scientist?</strong></p><p><strong>And you want to acquire the quantitative skills needed for the job?</strong></p><p>Well then, you’ve come to the right place!&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p><strong><em>Statistics for Data Science and Business Analysis is here for you! (with TEMPLATES&nbsp;in Excel included)</em></strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>This is where you start. And it is the perfect beginning! &nbsp; </strong></p><p>In no time, you will acquire the fundamental skills that will enable you to understand complicated statistical analysis directly applicable to real-life situations.

&nbsp; </p></li></ul><p>It is no secret that a lot of these topics have been explained online. Thousands of times. However, it is next to impossible to find a structured program that gives you an understanding of why certain statistical tests are being used so often. Modern software packages and programming languages are automating most of these activities, but this course gives you something more valuable – critical thinking abilities. Computers and programming languages are like ships at sea. They are fine vessels that will carry you to the desired destination, but it is up to you, the aspiring data scientist or BI analyst, to navigate and point them in the right direction.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p><strong>Teaching is our passion</strong>

&nbsp; </p><ol><li><p><strong>Salary/Income</strong> – careers in the field of data science are some of the most popular in the corporate world today.

<p>The course is just 36 minutes - you can finish it over a lunch break! That’s how long it takes to complete the videos in this course, and come away with a strong understanding of the use of Excel in business. You’ll learn many of the important Excel functions: IF, VLOOKUP, pivot tables and charts, including line charts, column charts and 3D column charts. You’ll learn how to enter and edit data and formulas. How to format text and numbers. How to filter and sort large tables of data and calculate totals.<br></p>



















<p>Only 36 minutes! How is this possible? I work through two business case studies on sales reporting and analysis, showing you how to use Excel to analyze data and answer questions, highlighting each step, and clearly explaining what I’m doing and why. You’ll learn how the functions work, and you’ll learn when, and why, to use them in business analytics. Full disclosure: plan for another 45 minutes or so to work through the case studies yourself. I provide all of the files. </p>





















<p>And it’s free! Even though free, it includes all of the features of the standard course: downloadable files, closed captions and quizzes, to help you learn and make it stick. </p>











<p>This course is designed for people who are preparing for an interview. Starting a new office job. Looking to jump-start their career. And even for those people who are thinking about a longer Excel course, but who aren't sure that Excel is right for them. </p>

Introduction to Financial Modeling,/course/financial-modeling-asimplemodel/,151668,Learn to build a simple integrated financial statement model.,"<p>  	                    This course will teach you how to use two years of historical income statement data and two years of historical balance sheet data to build a fully integrated financial statement model. <strong>It is designed for those new to financial models.</strong></p>  <p>  	<strong>        Section 1 </strong>will introduce the accounting equation and the three primary financial statements in the context of building a financial model. The content starts with the accounting equation, which is the single most important concept in accounting. The remaining three videos introduce the financial statements one at a time with a focus on the relationships that are important as you build financial models.  </p>  <p>  	        All of the material is provided via video-driven instruction with notes in pdf format to help follow along.  </p>  <p>  	<strong>        Section 2</strong> will walk through integrating the three primary financial statements and creating a five-year projection. The first video provides a quick overview of the process. It is an easier process to grasp if thought of as a series of steps. It will also make it easier to measure progress as you work through the longer video. The video in Lecture 2 will walk you through the process of building the model cell by cell.  </p>  <p>  	        Because you are walking through the entire process of building a model, the video in Lecture 2 runs long: 35 minutes total. My advice would be to download the excel template attached to this lecture and build the model as the video progresses. Building the model yourself is the best way to fully understand the process.  </p>  <p>  	<strong>       In my opinion, if you want to build a strong financial modeling skill set, a thorough understanding of how an integrated financial statement model works is one of the most important things you can learn.</strong>  </p>  <p>  	      The last video in this section will explain circular references and how to fix broken models. It can be incredibly frustrating to finish a model and realize that it does not ""balance."" This video will help avoid that frustration.  </p>  <p>  	            I hope the content is useful to you! Please feel free to email me (peter@ASimpleModel.com) with any feedback.  </p>  <p>  	       Note: The longer video has some white noise in the background that I am having edited out. I hope to have a cleaner audio file up soon. Thanks for your patience!  </p>",finance-and-accounting,financial-modeling-and-analysis

This is the actual algorithmic trading!</em></p><p>This algorithmic trading course was re-recorded completely! Thanks to all feedbacks from the traders!</p><p>Hello! My name is Petko Aleksandrov, and I am the Head trader at Trading Academy, where we teach Forex Algorithmic trading.&nbsp;I&nbsp;have over 10 000 students joining my Forex algorithmic trading&nbsp;course every year, which makes me extremely happy.</p><p>Because of this, I have decided to launch a sweet and short course with the top 10&nbsp;Expert Advisors that<strong> </strong>I&nbsp;use monthly - included!</p><p>While many Forex courses will teach you nothing but a theory, finding a practical approach like this one, where you will receive ready-to-use Robots for trading, is very difficult.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What will you learn in this Forex Algorithmic trading course?</strong></p><ul><li><p>Select a regulated Forex broker, which is the most critical first step in professional trading</p></li><li><p>You will become familiar with the Meta Trader platform, which is the only trusted Forex Algorithmic trading platform</p></li><li><p>How to export Historical data from your broker and how to use it (the required script is included in the course)</p></li><li><p>How to create an unlimited number of strategies fully automatically using the Historical data</p></li><li><p>The process of filtering the strategies and selecting which ones to use for trading</p></li><li><p>You will learn how to place my Top 10 Expert Advisors over the trading platform</p></li><li><p>How to follow the performance of the Expert Advisors, and how to separate the most profitable ones, placing them into a separate account</p></li></ul><p>No prior knowledge of trading is needed - this Forex Algorithmic trading course is geared for absolute beginners.</p><p><br></p><p>This course is also suitable for anyone who has not achieved satisfying results in trading. Many people have been trading for years but cannot find their profitable strategy. This course will teach you how to create hundreds of systems and select the top Expert Advisors. And if you do not want to do that by yourself, you will have access to my Top 10 GBPUSD EAs that <strong>I use MONTHLY!</strong></p><p>As a currency, I have chosen the GBPUSD because this is one of the most stable currency pairs with a low spread, making it suitable for Forex algorithmic trading. It is fundamentally important when trading with Expert Advisors to use currencies with a small spread. This way we increase our profits.</p><p>I will provide the 10&nbsp;Expert Advisors ready for trading, and in addition, I will make sure they are always suitable for the current market conditions. This way, you will have Expert Advisors that are always applicable to the current market conditions.</p><p>All you need to do is follow their performance and choose the best Forex robot for yourself. I&nbsp;have used EA&nbsp;Studio, a professional strategy builder. You will see the complete process I followed, and If you want to use the strategy builder for yourself, you can sign up for a free trial version and practice generating your own strategies.</p><p>However, if you prefer to use my robots, you can, because I have included them in this course. At the end of the course,<strong> </strong>I will show you the performance of the Expert Advisors:<strong> +700 pips in 5 days.</strong></p><p>It is essential to have precise statistics when you are trading with Expert Advisors. This way, every trader can find the top performers for a predefined period.</p><p><br></p><p>When we do Forex algorithmic trading, we follow a simple concept:</p><ul><li><p>trade many Expert Advisors in one trading&nbsp;account</p></li><li><p>follow their performance, and we place the Top Robots in a separate account</p></li><li><p>always trade the Expert Advisors that are profiting on the current market conditions</p></li><li><p>If any of the Expert Advisors becomes unprofitable, we replace it with another one that we already have tested</p></li></ul><p>Familiar mistake traders make buying expensive Expert Advisors and then realizing ""It has stopped working.""</p><p>It hasn't; the market simply changed. That is why you need to have many Expert Advisors on a Demo trading account and those currently profiting in a separate live performance. This way, we use the best Expert Advisors for current market conditions, diversify our risk on many Expert Advisors, and do not rely on just one. This is the only profitable Forex algorithmic trading method.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Who is your instructor?</strong></p><p>I am Petko Aleksandrov, founder of Trading Academy. I have specialized in Forex Algorithmic trading, as this is the easiest way to trade on the Forex market – there is no stress and no emotions. I focus on creating many Expert Advisors, testing them, and selecting which ones to use. This is precisely what I will share with you in this course.</p><p>Algorithmic trading is the better choice for me for one more reason: we do not need to spend all of our time in front of our trading screen, drawing lines, and analyzing, watching fundamental news and predictions, etc.</p><p>We place our Expert Advisors on our charts, and they trade for us.</p><p><em>Let me know if you have any questions. I always answer my students.</em><strong><em> </em></strong>It is fundamentally important to have excellent communication, so this way, I ensure that everything is clear to everyone.</p><p>If you decide that this Forex Algorithmic trading system does not suit your trading style, you can always use the <strong>30-day money-back guarantee.</strong></p><p>Enroll now, and I will help you to make your trading easier!</p><p>See you in class!</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",finance-and-accounting,investing-and-trading

Fortunately, the second best time is today!&nbsp; Git is an essential tool for work in any code-related field, from data science to game development to machine learning.&nbsp; This course covers everything you need to know to start using Git and Github in the real-world today!</p><p>The course's 20+ sections are broken down into four separate units:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Git Essentials </strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Next Level Git</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Github &amp; Collaboration</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>The Tricky Bits</strong></p></li></ul><p>We start off with <strong>Git Essentials.</strong>&nbsp; The goal of this unit is to give you all the essential Git tools you need for daily use.&nbsp; We start off talking about version control software, what it is, why it matters, and the history of Git.&nbsp; Then we install Git and run through the Unix commands you'll need to work with Git (you can skip this if you're already familiar).&nbsp; The bulk of this unit is focused on teaching the core Git mechanics like <strong>committing </strong>and <strong>branching</strong> and the associated concepts: the working directory, the repository, the staging area, etc.&nbsp; &nbsp; We cover Git commands including: git init, git add, git commit, git status, git log, git branch, and git merge.&nbsp; We end with a detailed look at branching, <strong>merging</strong>, and <strong>resolving conflicts</strong>. </p><p>Then we move on to out <strong>Next Level Git </strong>unit, where we cover additional commands and Git concepts that are extremely useful, but maybe not as ""core"" as the Git Essentials.&nbsp; We start with a comprehensive look at the <strong>gif diff</strong> command and the various comparisons that we can make between commits, branches, the working directory, the staging area, and more!&nbsp; We pay special attention to reading and parsing the dense output generated by diffs.&nbsp; Then we shift our focus to stashing with the <strong>git stash </strong>command, a ""convenience command"" that many users love incorporating into their Git workflow.&nbsp; Finally, we dive deep into <strong>undoing changes and time traveling</strong> with Git.&nbsp; We learn how to revisit earlier work, detach and re-attach HEAD, and discard changes.&nbsp; We cover git commands that help us undo changes including <strong>git checkout</strong>, <strong>git restore</strong>, <strong>git reset</strong>, and <strong>git revert</strong>.</p><p>Next up, we change gears to focus on <strong>Github &amp; Collaboration</strong>.&nbsp; We start by exploring Github (and similar tools) that host remote repositories and discussing the benefits they provide.&nbsp; We create our own Github repositories and sync up changes between our remote and local repositories using the <strong>git push</strong>, <strong>git pull</strong>, and <strong>git fetch</strong> commands.&nbsp; We then focus on commonly used <strong>collaboration workflows</strong> that students may encounter in the real world: <strong>feature branching</strong>, <strong>pull requests</strong>, <strong>forking &amp; cloning</strong>, and more! We discuss <strong>contributing to open source </strong>projects and configuring Github repositories for collaboration. We also spend some time learning about useful Github features including Github <strong>Gists </strong>and <strong>Github Pages</strong> for free static hosting.</p><p>The last unit in the course, <strong>The Tricky Bits</strong>, is really just a collection of useful Git command and advanced topics.&nbsp; We start by covering one of the ""scarier"" Git commands: <strong>rebasing</strong>!&nbsp; We discuss the potential benefits and pitfalls of rebasing and compare it to merging.&nbsp; Then we learn how to clean up our Git history by rewording, editing, dropping, and <strong>squashing</strong> commits using the <strong>interactive rebase</strong> command.&nbsp; Next, we discuss <strong>Git tags</strong> (lightweight and <strong>annotated tags</strong>) semantic versioning and tagging workflows.&nbsp; After that, we move on to a deep dive into the inner workings of Git.&nbsp; We discuss the files and folders Git uses internally, the role of <strong>hashing</strong> functions in Git, and the role of Git objects (<strong>blobs</strong>, <strong>trees</strong>, etc.). Next, we talk about reference logs and the <strong>git reflog</strong> command.&nbsp; Specifically, we learn how we can use reflogs to rescue ""lost"" commits and <strong>undo rebases</strong>.&nbsp; Finally, we learn how to write custom and powerful <strong>Git aliases</strong>!</p><p>Throughout the course, you'll find tons and tons of diagrams and visual references I've created to try and explain Git.&nbsp; The course also includes exercises I've tested on my in-person students, to give you an opportunity to practice the concepts in the course along the way.&nbsp; If you are reading this sentence, I congratulate you on making it this far :) I&nbsp;hope you enjoy the course!</p>",development,development-tools

The Top 5 Machine Learning Libraries in Python,/course/the-top-5-machine-learning-libraries-in-python/,1198574,A Gentle Introduction to the Top Python Libraries used in Applied Machine Learning,"<p><strong>Recent Review from Similar Course:</strong></p>

<p>""This was one of the <strong>most useful classes</strong> I have taken in a long time. <strong>Very specific, real-world examples</strong>. It covered several instances of 'what is happening', 'what it means' and 'how you fix it'. <strong>I was impressed.</strong>""  Steve

  </p>





















<p>Welcome to <strong>The Top 5 Machine Learning Libraries in Python.</strong>  This is an introductory course on the process of building <strong>supervised machine learning models</strong> and then using libraries in a computer programming language called <strong>Python</strong>. 

  </p>





















<p>What’s the <strong>top career in the world</strong>? Doctor? Lawyer? Teacher? Nope.<strong> None of those.</strong> 

  </p>





















<p>The top career in the world is the <strong>data scientist.</strong> Great. What’s a data scientist? 

  </p>





















<p>The area of study which involves <strong>extracting knowledge from data</strong> is called Data Science and people <strong>practicing </strong>in this field are called as <strong>Data Scientists.</strong> 

  </p>





















<p>Business generate a <strong>huge amount of data. </strong> The data has tremendous value but there so much of it where do you begin to look for value that is actionable? That’s where the data scientist comes in.  The job of the data scientist is to <strong>create predictive models</strong> that can find hidden patterns in data that will give the business a competitive advantage in their space. 

  </p>





















<p>Don’t I need a PhD?  <strong>Nope</strong>. Some data scientists do have PhDs but it’s <strong><em>not a requirement.</em></strong>  A similar career to that of the data scientist is the <strong>machine learning engineer.</strong> 

  </p>





















<p>A <strong>machine learning engineer</strong> is a person who <strong>builds predictive models,</strong> scores them and then puts them into production so that others in the company can consume or use their model.  They are usually <strong>skilled programmers</strong> that have a solid background in data mining or other data related professions and they have learned predictive modeling. 

  </p>





















<p><strong>In the course</strong> we are going to take a look at what machine learning engineers do. We are going to learn about the <strong>process of building supervised predictive models</strong> and build several using the most widely used programming language for machine learning. <strong>Python.</strong> There are literally hundreds of <strong>libraries </strong>we can import into Python that are machine learning related. 

  </p>





















<p>A <strong>library </strong>is simply a group of code that <strong>lives outside the core language</strong>. We “<em>import it”</em> into our work space when we need to use its functionality. We can mix and match these libraries like Lego blocks. 

  </p>





















<p>Thanks for your interest in the <strong>The Top 5 Machine Learning Libraries in Python </strong>and we will see you in the course.<strong> </strong>

C Programming For Beginners - Master the C Language,/course/c-programming-for-beginners-/,1467808,C Programming will increase career options.  Become a better dev in other languages by learning C.   Pointers explained,"<p>Have you never programmed a computer before, and think or have been told that C is a good programming language to get started with.  <strong>It is!</strong></p>

<p>Maybe you have some experience with other programming languages, but want to learn C.  <strong>It's a great language to add to your resume!</strong></p>



<p>Or perhaps you are stuck in a low paying programming job, and want to move up to a better, more senior position.  <strong>Learning C can help you!</strong><br></p>



<p>The fact is, learning how to program in C is not only an excellent programming language to get started with, but it will also make you a better programming in other computer languages!</p>



<p><strong>Why learn C ?</strong><br></p>



<p>C is often considered to be the mother of all languages because so many other languages have been based on it.</p>



<p>Though C is simple it is one of the <strong>most powerful languages ever created</strong>.  Considering it was created over 40 years ago, it is still used heavily and is usually in the top 5 or 10 most popular and most widely programming languages in the world.<br></p>



<p>Learning C can actually make you a better programming in other languages like C++, Java, or C# by equipping you with a mental model of what the computer is actually doing when you run your programs.<br><br>By learning how things really work ""under the hood"", and understand memory space, CPU architecture and so on, you can create more efficient programs, and obtain a huge advantage over other programmers in the process.</p>



<p>If you want to become a better developer, learning C is a great way to start!</p>



<p><strong><strong></strong>Why enrolling in this course is the best decision you can make.</strong><br></p>





<p>By the end of this course, you will understand the fundamentals of the C Programming Language, and make yourself more marketable for entry level programming positions.</p>



<p>You will understand variables and the different data types, be able to utilize functions and arrays, understand the  concept of pointers, learn about control flow (decision statements and iteration).</p>



<p>You will be in a position to apply for real-time programming positions, and truly understand the core language that most modern languages are based on!</p>



<p>If you have previously used the C programming language, then this course will deepen your understanding of it. If you have never used it, no problem, you will see that it can help you become a more efficient C developer.<br></p>





<p>The course will be constantly refined in the future based on student feedback!</p>



<p><strong>This course does not skip on the details.  You will learn how to write high quality code and become an excellent problem solver.  This course does not just present how to code in the C programming language, but, also includes all the details on ""why"" you are doing the things you are doing.  At the end of this course, you will fully understand the concepts of the C Programming language.<br></strong></p>



<p>Your instructor, Jason Fedin has been teaching students for over 12 years via online classes at over 10 different online Universities. He has created many different class curriculums, ranging from mobile programming to bash scripting to Object-Oriented Design and of course the C programming language.</p>



<p>Additionally, he has been developing software for over 16 years in the real world at various companies, specializing in Object-Oriented Development and Mobile Applications.</p>





<p>This means you are learning from someone who has all the professional training, skills, and experience you need to teach you how to become proficient in the C programming language.</p>

<p>If you are ready to get that first paid programming job, or to move up to a more senior programming position, then this course is for you!<br></p>

Join a live online community of over 900,000+ developers and a course taught by industry experts that have actually worked both in Silicon Valley and Toronto with React.js.</strong> <br><br>Using the latest version of React <em>(React 18)</em>, this course is focused on efficiency. Never spend time on confusing, out of date, incomplete tutorials anymore. <strong>Graduates of Andrei’s courses are now working at Google, Tesla, Amazon, Apple, IBM, JP Morgan, Meta, + other top tech companies.</strong></p><p>We guarantee you this is the most comprehensive online resource on React. This project based course will introduce you to all of the modern toolchain of a React developer in 2023. Along the way, we will build a massive e-commerce application similar to Shopify using React, Redux, React Hooks, React Suspense, React Router, GraphQL, Context API, Firebase, Redux-Saga, Stripe + more. This is going to be a full stack app (MERN stack), using Firebase.</p><p>The curriculum is going to be very hands on as we walk you from start to finish of releasing a professional React project all the way into production.&nbsp;We will start from the very beginning by teaching you React Basics and then going into advanced topics so you can make good decisions on architecture and tools on any of your future ReactJS projects. </p><p>All code is going to be provided step by step and even if you don’t like to code along, you will get access to the the full master project code so anyone signed up for the course will have their own project to put on their portfolio right away.<br><br>The topics covered will be:</p><p><strong>- React Basics</strong></p><p><strong>- React Router</strong></p><p><strong>- Redux</strong></p><p><strong>- Redux&nbsp;Saga</strong></p><p><strong>- Asynchronous Redux</strong></p><p><strong>- React Hooks</strong></p><p><strong>- Context API</strong></p><p><strong>- React Suspense + React Lazy</strong></p><p><strong>- Firebase</strong></p><p><strong>-&nbsp;Stripe API</strong></p><p><strong>- Styled-Components</strong></p><p><strong>- GraphQL</strong></p><p><strong>- Apollo</strong></p><p><strong>- PWAs</strong></p><p><strong>- React Performance</strong></p><p><strong>- React Design Patterns</strong></p><p><strong>- Testing with Jest and Snapshot testing</strong></p><p><strong>- React Best Practices</strong></p><p><strong>- Persistance + Session Storage</strong></p><p><strong>- State Normalization</strong></p><p><strong>+ more</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Wait wait… I know what you’re thinking. Why aren’t we building 10+ projects? Well, here’s the truth: Most courses teach you React and do just that. They show you how to get started, build 10 projects that are simple and easy to build in a day, and just add some CSS to make them look fancy. In real life though, you’re not building silly applications. When you apply to jobs, nobody is going to care that you built a really pretty To Do app. Employers want to see you build large apps that can scale, that have good architecture, and that can be deployed to production.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Let me tell you 3 reasons why this course is different from any other React tutorial online:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>1</strong>. You will build the biggest project you will see in any course. This type of project would take you months to implement yourself.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2.</strong> This course is taught by 2 instructors that have actually worked for some of the biggest tech firms using React in production. Yihua has been working on some of the biggest e-commerce websites that you have definitely heard of and probably have shopped at. Andrei has worked on enterprise level React applications for large IPOed tech firms in Silicon Valley as well as Toronto. By having both of them teach, you get to see different perspective and learn from 2 senior developers as if you are working at a company together.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3.</strong> We learn principles that are important beyond just what you learn as a beginner. Using the instructor's experiences you learn about design patterns, how to architect your app, organize your code, structure your folders, and how to think about performance. Let’s just say we don’t shy away from the advanced topics.</p><p><br></p><p>This course is not about making you just code along without understanding the principles so that when you are done with the course you don’t know what to do other than watch another tutorial. No! <strong>This course will push you and challenge you to go from an absolute beginner in React to someone that is in the top 10% of React developers.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Taught By:<br></strong></p><p>Andrei&nbsp;Neagoie is the instructor of the <strong>highest rated Development courses on Udemy as well as&nbsp;one of the fastest&nbsp;growing.&nbsp;</strong>His graduates have&nbsp;moved&nbsp;on to work for&nbsp;some of the biggest tech&nbsp;companies around the world like Apple, Google, Amazon, JP Morgan, IBM, UNIQLO etc...&nbsp;He&nbsp;has&nbsp;been working as a senior software developer in&nbsp;Silicon Valley and Toronto for many years,&nbsp;and&nbsp;is now taking all that he has learned,&nbsp;to teach&nbsp;programming skills and&nbsp;to help you&nbsp;discover the amazing career opportunities that being a developer allows in&nbsp;life.&nbsp;</p><p>Having been&nbsp;a self taught programmer,&nbsp;he understands that there is an&nbsp;overwhelming number of online courses, tutorials and books&nbsp;that are overly verbose and inadequate at teaching proper skills.&nbsp;Most people feel paralyzed and don't know where to start when learning a complex subject matter, or even worse, most people don't have $20,000 to spend on a coding bootcamp.&nbsp;<strong>Programming skills should be affordable and open to all. An education material&nbsp;should teach real life skills that are current and&nbsp;they should not waste a student's valuable time.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Having learned important&nbsp;lessons from working for Fortune 500 companies, tech startups, to even&nbsp;founding his own business, he is now dedicating 100% of his time to&nbsp;teaching others valuable&nbsp;software development skills&nbsp;in order to take control of their life and work in an exciting industry with infinite possibilities.&nbsp;</p><p>Andrei promises you that there are no other courses out there as comprehensive and as well explained.&nbsp;<strong>He believes that in order to learn anything of value, you need to start with the foundation and develop the roots of the tree. Only from there will you be able to learn concepts and specific skills(leaves) that connect to the foundation. Learning becomes exponential when structured in this way.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Taking his experience in educational psychology and coding, Andrei's courses will take you on an understanding of complex subjects that you never thought would be possible.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p><strong>See you inside the courses!<br><br>--------<br><br>Yihua Zhang is one of the Instructors of Zero To Mastery, one of the highest rated and fastest growing Web Development academies on Udemy</strong>.

Complete C# Masterclass,/course/complete-csharp-masterclass/,1581488,"Learn C# Programming - WPF, Databases, Linq, Collections, Game Development with Unity. More than just the C# basics!","<p><strong>The course gets updated frequently - </strong>Last update: <strong>23. May 2023</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Have you ever had an idea for a program, an app, or a game?</strong></p><p>Maybe you want to work as a developer? <strong>Then you are in the right place.</strong> In this course, you are going to discover how to become a c# developer - one of the best programming languages on earth!</p><p>C# is one of the few programming languages which allows you to create amazing cross-platform Mobile Apps, Games, and PC Programs.&nbsp;</p><p>Bringing an Idea to life is one of the best feelings one can have, but the path to get there is often full of challenges. So I have created a course that makes this path as easy as possible all with the help of c# so that you become a skilled c# developer!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>You start off by learning the C# basics and C# programming concepts in general:</strong></p><ul><li><p>variables</p></li><li><p>methods</p></li><li><p>arrays</p></li><li><p>if statements</p></li><li><p>loops</p></li></ul><p><strong>Then you learn the three pillars of Object-oriented programming.</strong></p><ul><li><p>Classes and Objects</p></li><li><p>Inheritance</p></li><li><p>Polymorphism</p></li></ul><p>Once you mastered them, you will go into advanced C# Topics, such as <strong>Databases and LINQ.</strong></p><p>In order to really become really good in c# programming, you have to program yourself, so I have created loads of exercises (and quizzes) for you to try for yourself to do c# programming and also to see how it is done afterward. <strong>Of course, you learn best programming practices along the way.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Equipped with those skills, you will build <strong>beautiful user interfaces with WPF</strong> - A framework, which makes creating GUI’s a piece of cake.<br><strong>By that point, you can create your very own complex programs.<br></strong>But what comes next is even cooler.</p><p><strong>Learn Game Development with Unity and C# - Build 2 awesome games.</strong></p><p>As C# can be used for multiple different areas of programming, I have decided to cover the most important ones. So I have added a whole bunch of chapters specifically designed for a C# developer and Unity game developer - arguably the best Game Engine in the world. In those chapters, you will discover how to create your very own video games by building <strong>pong, the mother of video games, and zig-zag,</strong> an amazing and successful endless runner game.</p><p>We live in a world where knowledge and work are shared more than ever, so using assets provided by others is a huge boost to your progress.&nbsp; You will learn how to use 3D assets to make an endless runner. Then you’ll use animations, reset the game, use particle systems, and finally create a map procedurally. <strong>That’s quite some advanced stuff right there.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I know that learning to code can be hard at times, and sometimes you just get stuck. But no worries, we are there for you. We answer each question as quickly as we can and make sure that you reach your goal of becoming a developer.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>WHO IS THIS COURSE FOR?</strong><br></p><p>The course is for anyone, who wants to learn c# and wants to become professionally good in c# programming.

<p>Do you want to start or switch career to Data Science and analytics?</p>











<p>If yes, then I have a new course for you. In this course, I cover the absolute basics of Data Science and Machine learning. This course will not cover in-depth algorithms. I have split this course into 3 Modules. This module, takes a 500,000ft. view of what Data science is and how is it used. We will go through commonly used terms and write some code in Python. I spend some time walking you through different career areas in the Business Intelligence Stack, where does Data Science fit in, What is Data Science and what are the tools you will need to get started. I will be using Python and Scikit-Learn Package in this course. I am not assuming any prior knowledge in this area. I have given some reading materials, which will help you solidify the concepts that are discussed in this lectures.</p>











<p>This course will the first data science course in a series of courses. Consider this course as a 101 level course, where I don't go too much deep into any particular statistical area, but rather just cover enough to raise your curiosity in the field of Data Science and Analytics.</p><p>The other modules will cover more complex concepts. </p>",development,data-science

The Complete Salesforce Certified Administrator Course,/course/salesforce-administrator/,693700,225 New Lessons Added! Includes Practice Test and ChatGPT Prompt Library - Most In-Depth and Current Admin Course Here!,"<p>140 NEW Video Lessons Added April, 2023 and 85 NEW Video Lesson Added May, 2023!</p><p>Other instructors just update their course title or subtitle with the current month...every month, but don't actually update their courses. </p><p>Don't believe me?&nbsp;Just check their courses at the beginning of each month. The only updates they make are to the title and subtitle.</p><p>Many of the instructors here are also my former students. Do you want to entrust your Salesforce career to someone with minimal experience and makes that their main selling point of their course...how little experience they had when they passed the exam just a year or two ago?</p><p>Don't be fooled. The amount of information and concepts that you need to understand in order to pass the Administrator exam is massive. This course is the most in-depth and complete course you'll find and I encourage you to not settle for a lightweight course that glosses over or entirely skips key concepts that you need to know.</p><p>There are no shortcuts or magic bullets, so don't be fooled by someone selling you a happy/easy path. You are on the correct course right now and here you will learn all that you need and be well thoroughly equipped for the exam.</p><p>I&nbsp;also do not hold down a 'day job' but work daily in the platform to stay up to date and to teach you the latest on the platform. Those with a day job simply don't have the time to devote to keep their courses current and especially don't have the time or interest to go very in-depth. That's why they make the shallowness of their courses the main selling point.</p><p>Also, there is a better way to learn Salesforce now. And that better way is leveraging the power of ChatGPT to deepen and broaden your Salesforce learning and understanding. I&nbsp;am the only Salesforce instructor teaching how to use ChatGPT to prepare for certification exams.</p><p>The reason this is is because ChatGPT makes many certification prep and resume/job sites and services OBSOLETE. </p><p>You can now create your own practice test questions, study guides, flash cards, and even get massive help on your resumes and interview prep, LinkedIn presence and more, for free, with ChatGPT.</p><p>Rather than trying to hide this new reality from you, I&nbsp;am embracing this revolutionary technology to take your learning and potential earning to the next level.</p><p>That is why I&nbsp;recorded a brand new and updated version of this course to leverage the power of ChatGPT to help you prepare for and pass the Salesforce Certified Administrator Exam in record time!</p><p>It would have been much easier for me to leave my well-established, top-selling and top-ranking admin course alone and just update the title and subtitle like other instructors, but I care too much about your success to rest. So I&nbsp;opted to record the additional 225+ videos of close to 20 hours of additional video content to make this course as up to date as possible. </p><p>This course includes a ChatGPT&nbsp;Prompt Library. You can copy and paste all of the prompts I&nbsp;use inside this course into your own free ChatGPT account.</p><p>This ChatGPT&nbsp;Prompt Library will help you to learn the now in-demand skills for Prompt Engineering and Design!</p><p>With the power of ChatGPT you can now do amazing things such as creating apex code to mass update records, create formula fields, validation rules, and so much more.</p><p>You will now find new knowledge area sections in the front of this course where I&nbsp;use ChatGPT to show you how to create Practice Tests, Study Guides, Flashcards and many more study aids.</p><p>I have worked on the Salesforce platform for over a decade. I&nbsp;have helped hundreds of thousands of students attain one or multiple Salesforce certifications.</p><p>I&nbsp;have been teaching on the Udemy platform since 2016 and this is my fourth full revamp of this course. I&nbsp;continually work in the latest Salesforce release to remain current and am constantly updating this course.</p><p>In addition to 500+ in-depth video lessons inside this course, you will also find a&nbsp;Practice Test at the end of this course.

Most people feel paralyzed and don't know where to start when learning a complex subject matter, or even worse, most people don't have $20,000 to spend on a coding bootcamp. <strong>Programming skills should be affordable and open to all. An education material should teach real life skills that are current and they should not waste a student's valuable time.</strong> Having learned important lessons from working for Fortune 500 companies, tech startups, to even founding his own business, he is now dedicating 100% of his time to teaching others valuable software development skills in order to take control of their life and work in an exciting industry with infinite possibilities.</p><p>Andrei promises you that there are no other courses out there as comprehensive and as well explained. <strong>He believes that in order to learn anything of value, you need to start with the foundation and develop the roots of the tree. Only from there will you be able to learn concepts and specific skills(leaves) that connect to the foundation. Learning becomes exponential when structured in this way.</strong></p><p>Taking his experience in educational psychology and coding, Andrei's courses will take you on an understanding of complex subjects that you never thought would be possible.<strong><br><br>--------<br></strong></p><p>Daniel is a design leader in tech with extensive experience in <strong>helping startups build and iterate</strong> on their products. Daniel is passionate about teaching and empowering designers and working with other disciplines to build purposeful products that meet both user and business goals.</p><p>His approach to design is always thoughtful and iterative. Daniel often finds himself working collaboratively with his team whether that is sketching concepts and flows or leading design strategy with team leads and external stakeholders.</p><p>Daniel is a multi faceted designer who’s expertise expands across multiple design disciplines. This includes <strong>User Experience</strong> and <strong>Visual Design</strong>, <strong>User Research</strong>, <strong>Product Strategy</strong>, <strong>Lean and Agile Design Methodologies</strong> and much more.

Warm colors like red, yellow, and orange can create a sense of energy and excitement, while cool colors like blue and green can create a calming effect.</p><p><br></p><p>Next, you'll want to choose the right fonts. The font you choose should be easy to read and match the tone of your design. Serif fonts, like Times New Roman, can convey a sense of tradition and formality, while sans-serif fonts, like Arial, are more modern and informal.</p><p><br></p><p>When it comes to arranging elements on your design, remember the rule of thirds. Divide your design into thirds both horizontally and vertically, and place your elements at the intersection points. This creates a sense of balance and visual interest.</p><p><br></p><p>Don't be afraid to experiment with different shapes and textures to add depth to your design. You can use shapes to create a sense of flow and movement, and textures to create a tactile feel.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, pay attention to the details. Make sure your design is free of spelling and grammar errors, and that everything is aligned and consistent. These small details can make a big difference in how professional and polished your design looks.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, creating a beautiful design from scratch takes practice and patience. Keep experimenting and trying new things, and soon you'll be creating stunning designs with ease.</p>",design,other-design

Feedback is Fuel,/course/feedback-is-fuel/,1337206,Become better at giving and receiving feedback in the workplace,"<p>Have you ever been part of a feedback conversation that didn’t go very well? One that didn’t seem to have a purpose or plan? One that seemed grounded in critique instead of growth?</p>

<p>Yeah? Me too. The ability to give and receive feedback in an impactful, respectful, and truly helpful way is so important to being successful in our jobs, yet many people struggle with this fundamental skill.  Many people find it so difficult to give feedback that they avoid it entirely, and they are terrified of receiving feedback.  When feedback is avoided, however, bad behaviors are never corrected, workplace resentments grow, and people are left to wonder whether they’re doing a great job or a terrible job.</p>









<p>In this course, the Udemy L&amp;D team shares some top tips on how to improve your experience with feedback, both giving it and receiving it!</p>









<p><strong>In “Feedback is Fuel” you will:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Establish a framework for giving all kinds of feedback (SBI Model)</p></li><li><p>Identify WHERE, WHEN and HOW to give feedback</p></li><li><p>Develop a growth mindset associated with giving and receiving feedback<br></p></li><li><p>Reduce the fear and anxiety associated with giving and receiving feedback<br></p></li></ul>









<p>In this course you will not only learn a framework for giving impactful affirmative and constructive feedback that people at all levels can use, you will practice having feedback conversations with real workplace scenarios and learn practical tips on how to receive feedback.  I'm thrilled to invite you to be a part of this engaging online training! </p>",personal-development,career-development

Practical PHP: Master the Basics and Code Dynamic Websites,/course/code-dynamic-websites/,130064,Code Your Very Own Dynamic Websites by Learning PHP Through Real-World Application & Examples,"<p><strong>Learn How to Code Dynamic Websites with PHP 5+ </strong><em>for absolute beginners!</em>  </p><p>This course is a total beginners guide to coding dynamic websites with PHP so you need <em>no prior knowledge or experience with PHP — </em>although, it is a good idea if you know <em>some</em> HTML &amp; CSS. <em>(My beginner's guide Build a Website from Scratch with HTML &amp; CSS will teach you everything you need to know about HTML &amp; CSS.)</em>  </p><p><strong>Practical Hands-on Approach</strong>  </p><p>My approach with this course, like many of my courses, is to take a practical ""hands on"" approach. While there will be some theory involved — every single lesson requires you to get your hands dirty and exercise what you've learned in that specific lesson. I find this to be the best approach, because you're able to retain much more of what you learned, and therefore, get up and running with maximizing your practical knowledge of PHP quickly!  </p><p><strong>Why Should I Learn PHP?</strong>  </p><p>So — why learn PHP? Well, PHP is a very powerful scripting language used by millions of websites. Some of the most popular websites and frameworks utilize PHP to build their dynamic websites. PHP works very well with HTML, and therefore will allow you to start coding dynamic websites quickly without having to learn some of the more complicated scripting languages out there.  </p><p><strong>You Will Love This Course</strong>  </p><p>I think you're going to love this course, and you're going to especially love what you're going to learn. When I first started learning PHP, I <em>couldn't wait </em>to start implementing what I learned into my websites! I think you'll feel the same.  </p><p><strong>It's Totally Free!</strong>  </p><p>Also, I am excited to be offering this course <em>absolutely free</em> for three reasons:  </p><ol><li><p>I don't want a purchasing decision to get in the way of you learning what I have to offer in this course.</p></li><li><p>I want as many people as possible to be able access the content.</p></li><li><p>I want to give you learning material so good that it <em>should </em>cost money.</p></li></ol><p><strong>The Final Project</strong>  </p><p>Throughout the course you will be building a handful of dynamic PHP examples, but in the last section of the course, we will build a dynamic website for a (fictional) restaurant.  </p><p>So, I invite you to join me in learning how to Code Dynamic Websites with PHP!  </p><p>Let's do this.</p>",development,web-development

Master Price Action! Complete Day Trading Strategy From A-Z,/course/price-action-strategy/,4693544,"Complete Day Trading Strategy Suitable for Forex, Indices, Stocks and Crypto. Supply & Demand + S/R Indicators Included!","<p><strong>What Will You Get From This Course?</strong></p><p>Offering a recipe for <strong>improving your trading results</strong>, this course gives you a <strong>straightforward price action strategy</strong> and a solid <strong>set of rules for managing risk</strong> like a professional, leaving behind all the noobie mistakes that made you lose money in the past.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>But Why Is This Course So Cheap? Is it worth the time?</strong></p><p>I know <strong>you're used to seeing trading courses, seminars, webinars and coaching programs being sold for hundreds or even thousands of dollars</strong> all around the Internet. The thing is my goal isn't to make a fortune out of selling educational content to you, since I'm already a successful trader and that alone makes me live a fulfilling life already (no, I'm not bragging).</p><p>The harsh truth about <strong>most ""traders"" selling online courses </strong>for ridiculous amounts of money is that their trading career isn't on the right path and they're trying to make up for it by <strong>turning you into their main source of income</strong>. This isn't fair or honest at all, but it's a reality.</p><p>On the other hand, I'm trying to be as transparent as possible. I will provide you with a <strong>complete strategy and methodology</strong> throughout this course hoping you're going to get a ton of value in the end, whilst the price you're paying when enrolling is simply going to cover all the production costs, future maintenance of videos and indicators/EAs, community management and so on. Therefore, the point is I'm not going to get rich off of you, but I do have to consider administrative costs along the way.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ok, But Still, What's In It For Me?</strong></p><p>Well, since we got the financial aspect out of the question, I must confess that <strong>one thing that really pisses me off is seeing lots of beginners in trading getting 'rekt' following the dreadful advice of all kinds of Twitter and YouTube ""gurus""</strong> who have literally no idea how markets work, what moves a market, how to properly read a chart or how to manage risk adequately.</p><p>If you take a look at their pitiful charts, you're immediately overwhelmed by the number of <strong>flashy indicators</strong> and colored lines - all of them making you unconsciously think <em>""Wow, this guy is smart and his analysis is so complex! I have to get at his level, fast!""</em>.</p><p>And then you find yourself throwing money at him, just to end up even more confused after joining his training program, weekend seminar or, even worse, his paid signals group.</p><p>Back to the initial question, my only benefit from you taking this course is the thought that maybe <strong>I'll get to convince you that trading is only as complicated as you make it to be</strong>, and that for this reason you don't have to throw away hundreds or thousands of dollars <em>(as I unfortunately did in my early days as a noob trader)</em> that would be better spent elsewhere. Now, let's get down to the nuts and bolts of this course.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What Are We Going To Cover Throughout The Course?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Introduction to Price Action trading</strong> - If you're a complete rookie, don't worry! We're gonna recap all the basics to get you on the same page. You're gonna be spoon-fed, the right way.</p></li><li><p><strong>Multi-timeframe analysis is always a must</strong> - You're going to learn the crucial role of analyzing a higher timeframe before diving into scalping and day trading on the 5-min or 15-min chart.</p></li><li><p><strong>Properly identifying and marking key S/R levels</strong> - How you draw your Support &amp; Resistance levels and Demand &amp; Supply Zones is at the core of your strategy. Most probably, you're doing it wrong already!</p></li><li><p><strong>This is where you mess up - Risk Management</strong> - Risk Tolerance, Stop Loss, Position Sizing - all are mandatory. You're gonna become a Risk Manager first, and then a trader.

You can learn real-world IT skills that you can immediately start using once you land an IT job. Plus, we provide hands-on labs. The best way to learn technology is just to do it. So, you are actually practicing what you learn as you learn it.</p><p>In this information course, you will learn key tips to start an IT Career.</p><p>Jobskillshare focuses exclusively on training you for the job skills required to get started in a technology career. The goal of 2–4-year schools is generally to provide a well-rounded education. That’s why traditional colleges and community colleges require that almost 50% of your classes are in “general education,” – which may or may not help you advance your career goals. By teaching only, the technology job skills you need, jobskillshare is able to “accelerate” your education time frame and ensure that the technology you are learning is not outdated. </p><p>In today’s economy where the demand for skilled IT workers significantly exceeds the supply of qualified candidates, most employers are more interested in whether or not you can do the job than whether you have a degree. According to recent Census data, only 38% of web developers have a four-year degree. In a survey of 2400 CIO’s by Robert Half Technology, 71% said they place more emphasis on “skills and experience than on whether or not a candidate attended college/university”. While there are still some companies and some positions that require a degree, the vast majority of job opportunities do not.

Introduction to Blender For Beginners,/course/introduction-to-blender-for-beginners/,898718,The complete beginners guide to Blender and the world of 3D.,"<p>Do you wish to create your own animated film one day? Or perhaps make your own game? But don't how to go about it or where to even start? If so, you may be looking around for cheap (and hopefully free) 3D software.<br></p>

<p>Blender is one such tool. It is a free, open-source 3D software that can do everything from 3D modeling, animation, rendering and game development. The tool continues to grow with newer and more awesome features being added every so often. Their current feature set is packed and rivals the most expensive 3D software today. One would have to see the awesome projects and quality renderings created by people who have not spent a cent.</p>









<p>In this course, you will learn the basics of (nearly) everything in Blender. Without needing to invest a whole lot of time or money, you will learn how to get started with 3D modeling, lighting, animation, sculpting, rendering, and physics to name a few with exercises spread throughout so that you can get your first experience with the software and gain overall confidence along the way. You will be one step closer to mastering Blender.</p>







<p><strong>What's in this course?</strong></p>









<p>The course is aimed to provide a gentle, yet thorough, introduction to Blender 3D so that you will go away with the confidence of working on your own dream projects. We won't just be looking at what each control does and call it done. The course provides a number of exercises (or mini-projects) on all the main components of 3D of which you are strongly encouraged to follow along and get your first experience with Blender. </p>







<p>Specifically,</p>







<ul><li>You will learn how to navigate through Blender and get comfortable with the user interface.</li><li>You will learn the bare basics of 3D modeling, lighting, animation, materials, texturing, rendering, sculpting, particles and physics.</li><li>You will work on small easy-to-follow exercises to help solidify your learning and gain your first experiences making something with Blender.</li><li>You can ask me for help anytime if you get stuck trying to do something.</li></ul>









<p>By the end of this course, you will have completed your first few mini-projects with Blender. Since we cover nearly everything in Blender, this will raise your confidence</p>









<p>With over 60+ lectures, there is so much to learn. Don't let this overwhelm you though. The course is designed to make the learning curve as smooth and as easy as possible so that you don't have to pull out all your hair in frustration in an attempt to learn Blender on your own.</p>







<p><strong>Who is this course for?</strong></p>







<p>This will be perfect for the absolute beginner of Blender and the world of 3D in general. There are no nasty jargon anywhere in this course and everything will be explained in a simple easy-to-understand manner.</p>







<p>You are not expected to know anything about Blender. You can start this course with no prerequisites (as we'll cover how to download and install Blender). If there was one prerequisite, it would be to have some passion for 3D (or whichever project you would need Blender for). That motivation will help push you to master Blender so that your dream movie or game can come to life.</p>







<p><strong>What is the expected outcome after the course?</strong></p>







<p>By the end of the course, you can expect to have a good understanding of the major components of Blender. You will gain experience and hopefully confidence in being able to pull off your own 3D projects without having to pull out your hair in frustration.</p>





<p>After that, the outcomes are endless. As you continue to work on your projects, you start to gain confidence in learning more advanced stuff. At this stage, making movies and/or game projects becomes a thing of reality. You could even meet one of the requirements for a Blender-related job!</p>





<p>Best of all, the course is designed to be flexible and will continue to expand as new features get added in or if you feel that I haven't covered an aspect that you would like to learn.</p>",design,3d-and-animation

<p>Debugging for SAP functional consultants is typically a gray area.

<p>Welcome to ABAP debugging - With a good knowledge of debugging, you don't need to rush to your ABAP consultant at every glitch. This course gives you the knowledge and mindset required to debug ABAP based customization - like user exits, BadIs, Z Programs and reports. While these come naturally to ABAP consultants, its takes a bit of guidance for us functional consultants to understand and use debugging to solve those hard to find bugs that are caused due to ABAP based customization.

This course will teach you a lot of different hard surface modeling techniques and modeling tools including beveling, subsurf modeling, and non-destructive modifier methods. It'll take you from setting up a reference photo in the background to completing a high quality, high resolution, 3d knife model for games.</p><p>The course starts off by taking you through creating the high-poly model of the knife that we'll later use for baking normal maps onto a low-poly, game-ready model.</p><p>To prepare our model for texturing I'll walk you through taking our low-poly knife model and UV unwrapping it in Blender. You'll learn how to specify how objects are unwrapped by manually adding seams to edges, how to modify and work with UVs, and how to look for UV stretching to make sure your textures will be applied without distortion.</p><p>After we're done UV&nbsp;unwrapping, I'll show you how to bake a normal map for the knife using Blender in order to make our efficient low-poly knife look more detailed and high resolution. Whether you want to use this knife inside Blender or export it for a game engine like Unity or Unreal, I'll show you how to make sure your model and its normal map look right in all software.</p><p>Then finally we'll pull our knife model into Substance Painter and Texture it. I'll show you how to bake normal maps in Substance Painter too, as they tend to come out a little bit better than in Blender. So then you'll know how baking works in both software. We'll use edge wear generators, smart materials, and other tools in Substance Painter to achieve the final look, and then I'll show you how to render your final knife in Substance Painter. I'll also show you how to export your textures so they can be used in programs like Blender or others.</p><p><br></p>",design,3d-and-animation

The number of questions on each topic is carefully selected based on the 4 domains of the actual AWS certification exam.</p><p>Some people are using brain dumps or exam dumps for the <strong>AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate</strong> <strong>SAA-C03 </strong>certification exam, which is totally absurd and highly unprofessional because those exam dumps will hinder you from attaining in-depth AWS knowledge. It can also result in you failing the actual AWS certification exam since Amazon regularly updates the exam coverage.</p><p>Please also note that these <strong>AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate practice tests</strong> <strong>SAA-C03 </strong>are not exam dumps and since Amazon shuffles the actual exam content from a question bank with hundreds to thousands of questions, it is nearly impossible to match what you can see here with the actual tests. Again, the key to passing the exam is a good understanding of AWS services and this is what our AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate SAA-C03<strong> </strong>practice tests are meant to do.</p><p>When I was reviewing for my <strong>AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate</strong> exam, I had a hard time finding comprehensive practice tests to help me pass my exam. I bought some of them in the market, but I was disappointed because there were a lot of technical and grammatical errors in the practice questions. This is why I created these AWS practice tests to help my fellow IT professionals in the industry. </p><p>We gave a considerable amount of effort to creating and publishing these AWS practice tests, including the laborious task of checking each item for any errors. We are confident that this will significantly help you pass your SAA-C03 exam.

Nonetheless, these Amazon Web Services practice exams provide a comprehensive assessment of which knowledge area you need improvement on and even help you achieve a higher score!</p><p>AWS&nbsp;always updates the content of their AWS&nbsp;Certification exam. This is why we regularly update the content of this practice tests reviewer to be on par with the new SAA-C03 version.</p>",it-and-software,it-certification

You can model your solutions before building them, explore the price points and calculations behind your estimate, and find the available instance types and contract terms that meet your needs. This enables you to make informed decisions about using AWS. You can plan your AWS costs and usage or price out setting up a new set of instances and services. AWS Pricing Calculator can provide the estimate of the AWS service usage based on the list of AWS services.</p><p>You should also note AWS is in the process of deprecating a similar tool called the Simple Monthly Calculator. This calculator provides an estimate of usage charges for AWS services based on certain information you provide. It helps customers and prospects estimate their monthly AWS bill more efficiently. </p><p><br></p><p>Incorrect options:</p><p><strong>AWS Cost &amp; Usage Report (AWS CUR)</strong> - The AWS Cost &amp; Usage Report (AWS CUR) contains the most comprehensive set of AWS cost and usage data available, including additional metadata about AWS services, pricing, credit, fees, taxes, discounts, cost categories, Reserved Instances, and Savings Plans. The AWS Cost &amp; Usage Report (AWS CUR) itemizes usage at the account or Organization level by product code, usage type and operation. These costs can be further organized by Cost Allocation tags and Cost Categories. The AWS Cost &amp; Usage Report (AWS CUR) is available at an hourly, daily, or monthly level of granularity, as well as at the management or member account level. The AWS Cost &amp; Usage Report (AWS CUR) cannot provide the estimate of the monthly AWS bill based on the list of AWS services.</p><p><strong>AWS Cost Explorer</strong> - AWS Cost Explorer has an easy-to-use interface that lets you visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over time. AWS Cost Explorer includes a default report that helps you visualize the costs and usage associated with your top five cost-accruing AWS services, and gives you a detailed breakdown of all services in the table view. The reports let you adjust the time range to view historical data going back up to twelve months to gain an understanding of your cost trends. AWS Cost Explorer cannot provide the estimate of the monthly AWS bill based on the list of AWS services.</p><p><strong>AWS Budgets</strong> - AWS Budgets gives the ability to set custom budgets that alert you when your costs or usage exceed (or are forecasted to exceed) your budgeted amount. You can also use AWS Budgets to set reservation utilization or coverage targets and receive alerts when your utilization drops below the threshold you define. Budgets can be created at the monthly, quarterly, or yearly level, and you can customize the start and end dates. You can further refine your budget to track costs associated with multiple dimensions, such as AWS service, linked account, tag, and others.&nbsp; AWS Budgets cannot provide the estimate of the monthly AWS bill based on the list of AWS services.</p><p>And reference links to help you learn further!</p><p>=======</p><p><strong>Instructor</strong></p><p>My name is Stéphane Maarek,&nbsp;I am passionate about Cloud Computing, and I will be your instructor in this course.

SQL for Data Analysis: Solving real-world problems with data,/course/sql-for-real-world-data-analysis/,3147996,"A simple & concise mySQL course (applicable to any SQL), perfect for data analysis, data science, business intelligence.","<p><strong>Note on the Short Version of the Course</strong></p><p>I have launched the course as a free, shortened version. It is an excellent introduction to the basics of handling data. Two points I want you to know:</p><p>1. The course so far is an in-depth view on a small &amp; important part of SQL, rather than a light-touch overview of everything.</p><p>2. Technically, the full paid version is on the way. But I am finding it very difficult to find the time to complete the lessons (between other projects and work). </p><p>Therefore for those who need a comprehensive course now, I'd suggest signing up to a couple of courses now including this one while it's free. That way you can learn now but also enjoy all the additional lessons for free when they arrive.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Note on the Communicating</strong></p><p>Udemy prevents instructors of Free courses from answering any questions from students. Therefore for now I cannot provide any feedback or respond to comments.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>Forget the dry, old, textbook approach to learning code. <strong>Forget endlessly drilling syntax</strong>. </p><p>This course puts SQL in context and <strong>gets you solving real-world business problems from Day 1</strong>. </p><p>You'll play the role of a data analyst at Australia's largest fictional consumer bank, with a <strong>uniquely rich relational database</strong> at your fingertips. This context brings SQL to life and makes it easier for you to <strong>understand deeply and quickly</strong>.</p><p>With this new approach, you'll be surprised to see that <strong>SQL is fun and simple to learn</strong>. My course guarantee is that you'll go from zero to functional SQL coder within the weekend. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Best features in a nutshell</strong></p><ul><li><p>In <strong>plain English</strong>, with <strong>business context</strong> and <strong>fun analogies</strong> to explain the otherwise dry syntax.</p></li><li><p><strong>Unique database</strong>, using a fictional bank relational database with incredibly rich transaction data to keep the course interesting and relevant.</p></li><li><p>Focuses deep on the absolute basics, to get you the <strong>strong foundations</strong> required for a data career.</p></li><li><p>Doesn’t cost money! If you sign up now while it’s free, you have <strong>lifetime free access</strong>, even as the course grows and becomes paid.</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Read on for more detail</em></strong></p><p><strong>My story and building the course</strong></p><p>My SQL learning experience was not ideal. When I started work I hadn’t the slightest idea what data was, let alone the power it brings to those who wield it skillfully. I took probably a year longer than necessary to master the SQL for data analytics. Even though I was practicing everyday on the job, I was slow to understand new concepts and struggled to remember new syntax.</p><p>Now as a full-time data analytics and insights manager, I have the hindsight to know it should have been much easier.</p><p>The main ingredients missing for me were:</p><ol><li><p>Structure </p><ol><li><p>What is important, what isn't, and why.</p></li></ol></li><li><p>Context</p><ol><li><p>Analogies, interesting examples, and plain English explanations.

An activity similar to what happens with the Ayahuasca inhibitor and a strong sense of well-being happens in humans, a DMT-like experienced in Ayahuasca.</p><p>Since the development of the heart system and the experience with the active heart system is much longer-lasting and allows the practitioner to evolve from a more conscious state.</p><p><br></p><p>What is holistic therapy for?</p><p><br></p><p>Reconnect with your essence and spirituality;</p><p>Have balance for holistic health, considering: body, mind, emotions and soul;</p><p>To make room for feelings and emotions;</p><p>Have healthy thoughts, attitudes and relationships;</p><p>Free yourself from blocks and fears;</p><p>Feeling good and happy with yourself;</p><p>Discover your virtues and what moves you, creating a new reality in your life!</p><p><br></p><p>But how does Holistic Therapy work?</p><p><br></p><p>Holistic Therapies are a set of varied techniques, but some essential elements make up the work of all of them, to lead us to well-being and health!</p><p><br></p><p>One of these elements is self-knowledge, that is, knowledge of ourselves.</p><p><br></p><p>Many of us are used to focusing only on what happens outside of us (others' opinions, news, happenings in society, at work, etc.). Self-knowledge is an invitation to understand what is going on inside us.</p><p><br></p><p>It is through self-knowledge exercises that we can: know our virtues, fears and traumas; welcome our emotions and thoughts; understand the signals the body transmits; knowing what brings well-being to our lives.</p><p><br></p><p>Another important element of Holistic Therapy is the concept of having a holistic view of health, comprising our physical, mental, emotional, social, environmental, energetic and spiritual aspects.</p><p><br></p><p>Holistic therapy also works with spirituality. It has nothing to do with “spiritism” or “religion”. From the most religious person, even the most atheist can practice spirituality!</p><p><br></p><p>Spirituality is described as: “the human propensity to seek meaning in life through concepts that transcend the tangible, looking for a sense of connection with something greater than itself”.

Yes, everything in our life is interconnected!</p><p><br></p><p>With the help of Holistic Therapy, you will have more self-knowledge to understand the causes of this dissatisfaction and how it is possible to modify this pattern through the techniques. And also, prevent it with awareness.</p><p><br></p><p>Also, another benefit of holistic techniques is that they are completely natural and non-invasive, so they don't generate any side effects.</p><p><br></p>",lifestyle,esoteric-practices

3 Minute French - Free taster course | Lessons for beginners,/course/3-minute-french-course-1/,920114,Learn to speak French you can use in everyday real-world situations - all in just 3-minute chunks!,"<p><strong>Bonjour! Hello and welcome to 3 Minute French :-)</strong></p><p>3 Minute French is a collection of online lessons that helps the complete beginner learn to speak French in simple, bite-sized chunks.</p><p>The lessons start off by giving you a few words that you can use to build your own sentences. For example, in lesson one, you'll learn these words and phrases:</p><p><strong>bon </strong>- <em>good<br></em><strong>c'est</strong> - <em>it is<br></em><strong>fantastique</strong> - <em>fantastic<br></em><strong>ici </strong>- <em>here<br></em><strong>très </strong>- <em>very<br></em><strong>ce n'est pas</strong> - <em>it isn't</em></p><p><br></p><p>With those words, you can build sentences like these:</p><p><strong>It's good.<br>It's here.<br>It's very good here.<br>It isn't here.<br>It isn't good; it's fantastic!</strong></p><p>(See if you can translate those five sentences above into French just by using those words and phrases.)</p><p><br></p><p>The lessons continuously build on what you've been learning, enabling you to express yourself fluently in French. As you move through the course, you'll pick up new vocabulary, useful grammar points and interesting ways to look at the structure of the French language that will give you plenty of ""Aha!"" moments.</p><p>The reason it's called ""3 Minute French"" is because the lessons are broken down into very short, three-minute chunks. Everybody, no matter how busy you are, has time to fit in a single three-minute lesson once a day, and in fact, by keeping learning to such short chunks, you'll reap huge benefits. Short but consistent daily lessons are more effective than a longer lesson once or twice a week, because you'll find you maintain enthusiasm, develop a learning habit and you'll also memorise everything much better.</p><p>If you've never learnt French before, or if you have had a bad experience with learning this beautiful language, the 3 Minute French lessons will help you to succeed.</p><p>Merci :-)</p><p><br></p><p>Kieran</p>",teaching-and-academics,language

<p>Simply hearing about these things is nothing but a pile of <br>information for you, but I want that my students to EXPERIENCE the <br>things they learn about. This is what turns information into KNOWLEDGE. <br>That’s why I’m including practical, self-hypnosis exercises in my <br>material. I think it is very important that you LIVE WHAT YOU LEARN, and<br> not just passively listen to it. This creates deeper understanding, <br>knowledge, and awareness. And that is already the first step towards <br>turning tedious everyday life into a miraculous creation. </p>















<p><strong>I will guide you step-by-step through the phases of</strong></p>











<ul><li>Taking RESPONSIBILITY for your life not just intellectually, 
but deep from your heart. (If you are already aware of your 
responsibility, it’s wonderful. The material helps you gain a further 
insight into the process of how you create your reality and to map out 
if there are parts left, where you don’t take full responsibility.)</li><li>As
 a next step I’ll help you to make the DECISION intellectually, 
emotionally and spiritually, whether to make a fundamental change or not
 and what does this imply</li><li>Step 3. I will help you to set the right OBJECTIVES.</li><li>Then you will learn the SKILLS you need to boost your power to act</li></ul>











<p>This is a lot to do, but take the toddler-approach to learning: <br>just think of the enthusiasm and fun they have learning to walk, even <br>though at that phase it’s a HUGE accomplishment! And they do it <br>laughing! </p>











<p>As a transforming hypnotist, I live what I teach. </p>









<p>Hypnosis has literally changed my life and me at my very core and if there was <br>something worth learning, then it was to understand my subconscious, <br>learn to communicate and cooperate with it. It was a wonderful gift!!! </p>









<p><br>And I want to share it with you! </p>









<p><br>What inspires me to do these courses is to help people, like you learn the skills, which enable them <br>to use their inner power, wisdom, and motivation. </p>











<p>I help them to connect with their inner self, to become spiritually independent so <br>that they no longer need gurus or constant assistance and guidance. All <br>they need is within themselves. All they need is to learn to access it. <br><br></p>



















<p><strong>What do you need?</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong></p>











<ul><li>You need an open mind and readiness to change and a desire to experience your potential.</li></ul>













<p><strong><br></strong></p>









<p><strong>What will you learn?</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong></p>











<ul><li>understand how to change your life in positive, beneficial ways</li><li>how to attract success and abundance</li><li>take responsibility for your current situation and make a decision for your future</li><li>set smart and motivating objectives</li><li>understand the basics of the skills you need to boost your actions</li><li>connect to your Real, Higher Self</li><li>improve your awareness</li><li>understand the trance state through which you have access to your subconscious</li><li>connect to your subconscious mind</li><li>understand the basic principles of how the subconscious mind works</li><li>understand the broader aspects of self-hypnosis</li><li>use suggestions properly and effectively</li></ul>
